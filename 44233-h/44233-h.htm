<h4><a id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h4>


<p>The collection of plays contained in this volume is unusually
representative, giving what might be called a cross-section of
Strindberg's development as a dramatist from his naturalistic revolt
in the middle eighties, to his final arrival at resigned mysticism and
Swedenborgian symbolism.</p>

<p>"Swanwhite" was written in the spring of 1901, about the time when
Strindberg was courting and marrying his third wife, the gifted Swedish
actress Harriet Bosse. In the fall of 1902 the play appeared in book
form, together with "The Crown Bride" and "The Dream Play," all of them
being issued simultaneously, at Berlin, in a German translation made by
Emil Schering.</p>

<p>Schering, who at that time was in close correspondence with Strindberg,
says that the figure of <i>Swanwhite</i> had been drawn with direct
reference to Miss Bosse, who had first attracted the attention of
Strindberg by her spirited interpretation of <i>Biskra</i> in "Simoom."
And Schering adds that it was Strindberg's bride who had a little
previously introduced him to the work of Maeterlinck, thereby
furnishing one more of the factors determining the play.</p>

<p>Concerning the influence exerted upon him by the Belgian
playwright-philosopher, Strindberg himself wrote in a pamphlet named
"Open Letters to the Intimate Theatre" (Stockholm, 1909):</p>

<p>"I had long had in mind skimming the cream of our most beautiful
folk-ballads in order to turn them into a picture for the stage.
Then Maeterlinck came across my path, and under the influence of
his puppet-plays, which are not meant for the regular stage, I wrote
my Swedish scenic spectacle, 'Swanwhite.' It is impossible either to
steal or to borrow from Maeterlinck. It is even difficult to become his
pupil, for there are no free passes that give entrance to his world of
beauty. But one may be urged by his example into searching one's own
dross-heaps for gold&mdash;and it is in that sense I acknowledge my debt to
the master.</p>

<p>"Pushed ahead by the <i>impression</i> made on me by Maeterlinck, and
borrowing his divining-rod for my purposes, I turned to such sources
[<i>i.e.</i>, of Swedish folk-lore] as the works of Geijer, Afzelius, and
Dybeck. There I found a superabundance of princes and princesses. The
stepmother theme I had discovered on my own hook as a <i>constant</i>&mdash;it
figures in twenty-six different Swedish folk-tales. In the same place I
found the resurrection theme, as, for instance, it appears in the story
of <i>Queen Dagmar</i>. Then I poured it all into my separator, together
with the <i>Maids</i>, the <i>Green Gardener</i> and the <i>Young King</i>, and in
a short while the cream began to flow&mdash;and for that reason the story
is my own. But it has also been made so by the fact that I have lived
through that tale in my own fancy&mdash;a Spring in time of Winter!"</p>

<p>Swedish critics have been unanimous in their praise of this play. John
Landquist, who has since become Strindberg's literary executor, spoke
of it once as "perhaps the most beautiful and most genuine fairy tale
for old or young ever written in the Swedish language." Tor Hedberg
has marvelled at the charm with which <i>Swanwhite</i> herself has been
endowed&mdash;"half child, half maid; knowing nothing, yet guessing all;
playing with love as a while ago she was playing with her dolls." On
the stage, too&mdash;in Germany as well as in Sweden&mdash;little <i>Swanwhite</i>
has celebrated great triumphs. Whether that figure, and the play
surrounding it, will also triumph in English-speaking countries,
remains still to be seen. But if, contrary to my hopes, it should fail
to do so, I want, in advance, to shift the blame from the shoulders of
the author to my own. In hardly any other work by Strindberg do form
and style count for so much. The play is, in its original shape, as
poetical in form as in spirit&mdash;even to the extent of being strongly
rhythmical in its prose, and containing many of the inversions which
are so characteristic of Swedish verse.</p>

<p>It is not impossible to transfer these qualities into English, but
my efforts to do so have had to be influenced by certain differences
in the very <i>grain</i> of the two languages involved. Like all other
languages, each possesses a natural basic rhythm. This rhythm varies
frequently and easily in Swedish, so that you may pass from iambic to
trochaic metre without giving offence to the ear&mdash;or to that subtle
rhythmical susceptibility that seems to be inherent in our very pulses.
But the rhythm dearest and most natural to the genius of the Swedish
language seems to be the falling pulse-beat manifested in the true
trochee. The swing and motion of English, on the other hand, is almost
exclusively, commandingly iambic. And it was not until I made the
iambic <i>rising</i> movement prevail in my translation, that I felt myself
approaching the impression made on me by the original. But for that
very reason&mdash;because the genius of the new medium has forced me into
making the movement of my style more monotonous&mdash;it is to be feared
that the rhythmical quality of that movement may seem overemphasised.
Should such a criticism be advanced, I can only answer: I have tried
several ways, and this is the only one that will <i>work</i>.</p>

<p>"Simoom" seems to have been written in 1888, in close connection with
"Creditors" and "Pariah." And, like these, it shows the unmistakable
influence of Edgar Allan Poe, with whose works Strindberg had become
acquainted a short while before. The play was first printed in one of
the three thin volumes of varied contents put out by Strindberg in 1890
and 1891 under the common title of "Pieces Printed and Unprinted." But,
strange to say, it was not put on the stage (except in a few private
performances) until 1902, although, from a purely theatrical viewpoint,
Strindberg&mdash;master of stagecraft though he was&mdash;had rarely produced a
more effective piece of work.</p>

<p>"Debit and Credit" belongs to the same general period as the previous
play, but has in it more of Nietzsche than of Poe. Its central figure
is also a sort of superman, but as such he is not taken too seriously
by his creator. The play has humour, but it is of a grim kind&mdash;one
seems to be hearing the gritting of teeth through the laughter. Like
"Simoom," however, it should be highly effective on the stage. It was
first published in 1893, with three other one-act plays, the volume
being named "Dramatic Pieces."</p>

<p>"Advent" was published in 1899, together with "There Are Crimes and
Crimes," under the common title of "In a Higher Court." Its name
refers, of course, to the ecclesiastical designation of the four weeks
preceding Christmas. The subtitle, literally rendered, would be "A
Mystery." But as this term has a much wider application in Swedish
than in English, I have deemed it better to observe the distinction
which the latter language makes between mysteries, miracle-plays, and
moralities.</p>

<p>The play belongs to what Strindberg called his "Inferno period," during
which he struggled in a state of semi-madness to rid himself of the
neurasthenic depression which he regarded as a punishment brought about
by his previous attitude of materialistic scepticism. It is full of
Swedenborgian symbolism, which, perhaps, finds its most characteristic
expression in the two scenes laid in "The Waiting Room." The name
selected by Strindberg for the region where dwell the "lost" souls of
men is not a mere euphemism. It signifies his conception of that place
as a station on the road to redemption or annihilation.</p>

<p>In its entirety the play forms a Christmas sermon with a quaint
blending of law and gospel. A prominent Swedish critic, Johan
Mortensen, wrote: "Reading it, one almost gets the feeling that
Strindberg, the dread revolutionist, has, of a sudden, changed into
a nice village school-teacher, seated at his desk, with his rattan
cane laid out in front of him. He has just been delivering a lesson in
Christianity, and he has noticed that the attention of the children
strayed and that they either failed to understand or did not care to
take in the difficult matters he was dealing with. But they must be
made to listen and understand. And so&mdash;with serious eyes, but with a
sly smile playing around the corners of his mouth&mdash;he begins all over
again, in that fairy-tale style which never grows old: 'Once upon a
time!'"</p>

<p>In November, 1907, a young theatrical manager, August Falck, opened the
Intimate Theatre at Stockholm. From the start Strindberg was closely
connected with the venture, and soon the little theatre, with its tiny
stage and its auditorium seating only one hundred and seventy-five
persons, was turned wholly into a Strindberg stage, where some of the
most interesting and daring theatrical experiments of our own day were
made. With particular reference to the needs and limitations of this
theatre, Strindberg wrote a series of "chamber plays," four of which
were published in 1907&mdash;each one of them appearing separately in a
paper-covered duodecimo volume.</p>

<p>The first of these plays to appear in book form&mdash;though not the
first one to be staged&mdash;was "The Thunder-Storm," designated on the
front cover as "Opus I." Two of the principal ideas underlying its
construction were the abolition of intermissions&mdash;which, according to
Strindberg, were put in chiefly for the benefit of the liquor traffic
in the theatre cafÃ©&mdash;and the reduction of the stage-setting to quickly
inter-changeable backgrounds and a few stage-properties. Concerning the
production of "The Thunder-Storm," at the Intimate Theatre, Strindberg
wrote subsequently that, in their decorative effects, the first and
last scenes were rather failures. But he held the lack of space
wholly responsible for this failure. His conclusion was that the most
difficult problem of the small theatre would be to give the illusion of
distance required by a scene laid in the open&mdash;particularly in an open
place surrounded or adjoined by buildings. Of the second act he wrote,
on the other hand, that it proved a triumph of artistic simplification.
The only furniture appearing on the stage consisted of a buffet, a
piano, a dinner-table and a few chairs&mdash;that is, the pieces expressly
mentioned in the text of the play. And yet the effect of the setting
satisfied equally the demands of the eye and the reason.</p>

<p>"The Thunder-Storm" might be called a drama of old age&mdash;nay, <i>the</i>
drama of man's inevitable descent through a series of resignations to
the final dissolution. Its subject-matter is largely autobiographical,
embodying the author's experiences in his third and last marriage,
as seen in retrospect&mdash;the anticipatory conception appearing in
"Swanwhite." However, justice to Miss Harriet Bosse, who was Mrs.
Strindberg from 1901 to 1904, requires me to point out that echoes
of the dramatist's second marriage also appear, especially in the
references to the postmarital relationship.</p>

<p>"After the Fire" was published as "Opus II" of the chamber-plays,
and staged ahead of "The Thunder-Storm." Its Swedish name is <i>BrÃ¤nda
Tomten</i>, meaning literally "the burned-over site." This name has
previously been rendered in English as "The Burned Lot" and "The Fire
Ruins." Both these titles are awkward and ambiguous. The name I have
now chosen embodies more closely the fundamental premise of the play.</p>

<p>The subject-matter is even more autobiographical than that of "The
Thunder-Storm"&mdash;almost as much so as "The Bondwoman's Son." The
perished home is Strindberg's own at the North Tollgate Street in
Stockholm, where he spent the larger part of his childhood and youth.
The old <i>Mason</i>, the <i>Gardener</i>, the <i>Stone-Cutter</i>, and other figures
appearing in the play are undoubtedly lifted straight out of real
life&mdash;and so are probably also the exploded family reputation and
the cheap table painted to represent ebony&mdash;although one may take
for granted that the process has not taken place without a proper
disguising of externals.</p>

<p>There is one passage in this little play which I want to point out as
containing one of the main keys to Strindberg's character and art. It
is the passage where <i>The Stranger</i>&mdash;who, of course, is none but the
author himself&mdash;says to his brother: "I have beheld life from every
quarter, from every standpoint, from above and from below, but always
it has seemed to me like a scene staged for my particular benefit."</p>

<p><i>An apartment in a mediÃ¦val stone castle. The walls and the
cross-vaulted ceiling are whitewashed. In the centre of the
rear wall is a triple-arched doorway leading to a balcony
with a stone balustrade. There are draperies of brocade over
the doorway. Beyond the balcony appear the top branches of a
rose-garden, laden with white and pink roses. In the background
there can be seen a white, sandy beach and the blue sea</i>.</p>

<p><i>To the right of the main doorway is a small door which, when
left open, discloses a vista of three closets, one beyond the
other. The first one is stored with vessels of pewter arranged
on shelves. The walls of the second closet are hung with all
sorts of costly and ornate garments. The third closet contains
piles and rows of apples, pears, melons, pumpkins, and so
forth</i>.</p>

<p><i>The floors of all the rooms are inlaid with alternating
squares of black and red. At the centre of the apartment stands
a gilded dinner-table covered with a cloth; a twig of mistletoe
is suspended above the table. A clock and a vase filled with
roses stand on the table, near which are placed two gilded
tabourets. Two swallows' nests are visible on the rear wall
above the doorway. A lion skin is spread on the floor near the
foreground. At the left, well to the front, stands a white bed
with a rose-coloured canopy supported by two columns at the
head of the bed (and by none at the foot). The bed-clothing is
pure white except for a coverlet of pale-blue silk. Across
the bed is laid a night-dress of finest muslin trimmed with
lace. Behind the bed stands a huge wardrobe containing linen,
bathing utensils, and toilet things. A small gilded table in
Roman style (with round top supported by a single column) is
placed near the bed; also a lamp-stand containing a Roman lamp
of gold. At the right is an ornamental chimney-piece. On the
mantel stands a vase with a white lily in it</i>.</p>

<p><i>In the left arch of the doorway, a peacock is asleep on a
perch, with its back turned toward the audience</i>.</p>

<p><i>In the right arch hangs a huge gilded cage with two white
doves at rest</i>.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. No&mdash;nor have I ever seen him. Is he handsome?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DUKE</span>. Dear heart, it will depend on your own eyes how he appears to you.</p>

beautiful.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DUKE</span>. My child, when still a cradled babe, your troth was plighted to
the youthful King of Rigalid. You have not seen him yet, such being
courtly usage. But the time to tie the sacred knot is drawing near. To
teach you the deportment of a queen and courtly manners, the king has
sent a prince with whom you are to study reading out of books, gaming
at chess, treading the dance, and playing on the harp.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. What is the prince's name?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DUKE</span>. That, child, is something you must never ask of him or anybody
else. For it is prophesied that whosoever calls him by his name shall
have to love him.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. Is he handsome?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DUKE</span>. He is, because your eye sees beauty everywhere.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. But is he beautiful?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DUKE</span>. Indeed he is. And now be careful of your little heart, and don't
forget that in the cradle you were made a queen.&mdash;With this, dear
child, I leave you, for I have war to wage abroad.&mdash;Submit obediently
to your stepmother. She's hard, but once your father loved her&mdash;and
a sweet temper will find a way to hearts of stone. If, despite of
promises and oaths, her malice should exceed what is permissible, then
you may blow this horn [<i>he takes a horn of carved ivory from under
his cloak</i>], and help will come. But do not use it till you are in
danger&mdash;not until the danger is extreme.&mdash;Have you understood?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. How is it to be understood?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DUKE</span>. This way: the prince is here, is in the court already. Is it your
wish to see the prince?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. Is it my wish?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DUKE</span>. Or shall I first bid you farewell?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. The prince is here already?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DUKE</span>. Already here, and I&mdash;already there&mdash;far, far away where sleeps
the heron of forgetfulness, with head beneath his wing.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. [<i>Leaping into the lap of the</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DUKE</span> <i>and burying her head in

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DUKE</span>. In all.</p>

the purging waters, grow white as swans, while evil ones turn
raven-black.</p>

would look like a diamond&mdash;but a blue sapphire, queen of the precious

cloud, black as velvet, passes by&mdash;and the sapphire is smiling&mdash;as

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. What message does the young king send his bride?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. This is his word to Lady Swanwhite&mdash;whom lovingly he
greets&mdash;that by the thought of coming happiness the long torment of
waiting will be shortened.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. I do speak of the king!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. Is his complexion light or dark?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. If he were dark, on seeing you he would turn light at once.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. There's more of flattery than wit in that! His eyes are blue?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. Are you to teach me how to spell?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. The young king is tall and blond and blue-eyed, with broad
shoulders and hair like a new-grown forest&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. Why do you carry a black plume?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. His lips are red as the ripe currant, his cheeks are white, and
the lion's cub needn't be ashamed of his teeth.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. Why is your hair wet?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. His mind knows no fear, and no evil deed ever made his heart
quake with remorse.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. Why is your hand trembling?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. We were to speak of the young king and not of me!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. So, you, you are to teach me?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. It is my task to teach you how to love the young king whose
throne you are to share.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. How did you cross the sea?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. In my bark and with my sail.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. And the wind so high?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Without wind there is no sailing.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. Little boy&mdash;how wise you are!&mdash;Will you play with me?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. What I must do, I will.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. And now I'll show you what I have in my chest. [<i>She goes to
the chest and kneels down beside it; then she takes out several dolls,

of sorrow that can never keep its face clean. In my own arms I have
carried her to the lavendrey, and there I have washed her with white
sand&mdash;but it only made her worse. I have spanked her&mdash;but nothing
helped. Now I have figured out what's worst of all!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. And what is that?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. [<i>After a glance around the room</i>] I'll give her a
stepmother!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. But how's that to be? She should have a mother first.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. I am her mother. And if I marry twice, I shall become a
stepmother.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Oh, how you talk! That's not the way!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. And you shall be her stepfather.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Oh, no!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. You must be very kind to her, although she cannot wash her
face.&mdash;Here, take her&mdash;let me see if you have learned to carry children
right.</p>

<p><i>The</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span> <i>receives the rattle</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. That's something you don't understand, I see. [<i>She takes
the doll and the rattle away from him and throws them back into the
chest; then she takes out the hobby-horse</i>] Here is my steed.&mdash;It has
saddle of gold and shoes of silver.&mdash;It can run forty miles in an
hour, and on its back I have travelled through Sounding Forest, across
Big Heath and King's Bridge, along High Road and Fearful Alley, all the
way to the Lake of Tears. And there it dropped a golden shoe that fell
into the lake, and then came a fish, and after came a fisherman, and so
I got the golden shoe back. That's all there was to that! [<i>She throws
the hobby-horse into the chest; instead she takes out a chess-board
with red and white squares, and chess-men made of silver and gold</i>]
If you will play with me, come here and sit upon the lion skin. [<i>She
seats herself on the skin and begins to put up the pieces</i>] Sit down,

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. It's like sitting in the grass&mdash;not the green grass of the
meadow, but the desert grass which has been burned by the sun.&mdash;Now you
must say something about me! Do you like me a little?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Are we to play?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. To play? What care I for that?&mdash;Oh&mdash;you were to teach me
something!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Poor me, what can I do but saddle a horse and carry arms&mdash;with
which you are but poorly served.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. You are so sad!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. My mother died quite recently.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. Poor little prince!&mdash;My mother, too, has gone to God in
heaven, and she's an angel now. Sometimes in the nights I see her&mdash;do
you also see yours?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. No-o.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. And have you got a stepmother?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Not yet. So little time has passed since she was laid to rest.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. Don't be so sad! There's nothing but will wear away in time,
you see. Now I'll give you a flag to gladden you again&mdash;Oh, no, that's
right&mdash;this one I sewed for the young king. But now I'll sew another
one for you!&mdash;This is the king's, with seven flaming fires&mdash;you shall
have one with seven red roses on it&mdash;but first of all you have to
hold this skein of yarn for me. [<i>She takes from the chest a skein of
rose-coloured yarn and hands it to the</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>] One, two, three, and
now you'll see!&mdash;Your hands are trembling&mdash;that won't do!&mdash;Perhaps you
want a hair of mine among the yarn?&mdash;Pull one yourself!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Oh, no, I couldn't&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. I'll do it, then, myself. [<i>She pulls a hair from her head
and winds it into the ball of yarn</i>] What is your name?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. You shouldn't ask.</p>

Might something dreadful happen?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. The duke has told you, I am sure.</p>

"eyes" were staring at</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span> <i>and the</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Who pulled away the curtain? Who made the bird behold us with
its hundred eyes?&mdash;You mustn't ask again!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. Perhaps I mustn't&mdash;Down, Pavo&mdash;there!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The curtain resumes its previous position</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Is this place haunted?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. You mean that things will happen&mdash;just like that? Oh, well,
so much is happening here&mdash;but I have grown accustomed to it. And then,
besides&mdash;they call my stepmother a witch&mdash;There, now, I have pricked my
finger!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. What did you prick it with?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. There was a splinter in the yarn. The sheep have been locked
up all winter&mdash;and then such things will happen. Please see if you can
get it out.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. We must sit at the table then, so I can see.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>They rise and take seats at the table</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. [<i>Holding out one of her little fingers</i>] Can you see
anything?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. What do I see? Your hand is red within, and through it all the
world and life itself appear in rosy colouring&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. Now pull the splinter out&mdash;ooh, it hurts!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. But I shall have to hurt you, too&mdash;and ask your pardon in
advance!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. Oh, help me, please!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. [<i>Squeezing her little finger and pulling out the splinter with
his nails</i>] There is the cruel little thing that dared to do you harm.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. Now you must suck the blood to keep the wound from festering.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. [<i>Sucking the blood from her finger</i>] I've drunk your
blood&mdash;and so I am your foster-brother now.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. My foster-brother&mdash;so you were at once&mdash;or how do you think
I could have talked to you as I have done?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. If you have talked to me like that, how did I talk to you?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. Just think, he didn't notice it!&mdash;And now I have got a
brother of my own, and that is you!&mdash;My little brother&mdash;take my hand!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. [<i>Taking her hand</i>] My little sister! [<i>Feels her pulse beating
under his thumb</i>] What have you there, that's ticking&mdash;one, and two,
and three, and four&mdash;&mdash;? <i>Continues to count silently after having
looked at his watch</i>.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. Yes, tell me what it is that ticks&mdash;so steady, steady,
steady? It cannot be my heart, for that is here, beneath my breast&mdash;Put
your hand here, and you can feel it too. [<i>The doves begin to stir and
coo</i>] What is it, little white ones?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. And sixty! Now I know what makes that ticking&mdash;it is the time!
Your little finger is the second-hand that's ticking sixty times for
every minute that goes by. And don't you think there is a heart within
the watch?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. [<i>Handling the watch</i>] We cannot reach the inside of the
watch&mdash;no more than of the heart&mdash;Just feel my heart!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SIGNE</span>. [<i>Enters from the pewter-closet carrying a whip, which she puts
down on the table</i>] Her Grace commands that the children be seated at
opposite sides of the table.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>The</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span> <i>sits down at the opposite end of the table. He and</i>
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span> <i>look at each other in silence for a while</i>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. Now we are far apart, and yet a little nearer than before.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. It's when we part that we come nearest to each other.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. And you know that?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. I have just learned it!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. Now my instruction has begun.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. You're teaching me!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. [<i>Pointing to a dish of fruit</i>] Would you like some fruit?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. No, eating is so ugly.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. Yes, so it is.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Three maids are standing there&mdash;one in the pewter-closet, one
among the clothes, and one among the fruits. Why are they standing
there?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. To watch us two&mdash;lest we do anything that is forbidden.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. May we not go into the rosery?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. The morning is the only time when I can go into the rosery,
for there the bloodhounds of my stepmother are kept. They never let me
reach the shore&mdash;and so I get no chance to bathe.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Have you then never seen the shore? And never heard the ocean
wash the sand along the beach?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. No&mdash;never! Here I can only hear the roaring waves in time of
storm.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Then you have never heard the murmur made by winds that sweep
across the waters?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. It cannot reach me here.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. [<i>Pushing his helmet across the table to</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>] Put it to
your ear and listen.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. [<i>With the helmet at her ear</i>] What is that I hear?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. The song of waves, the whispering winds</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. No, I hear human voices&mdash;hush! My stepmother is
speaking&mdash;speaking to the steward&mdash;and mentioning my name&mdash;and that of
the young king, too! She's speaking evil words. She's swearing that I
never shall be queen&mdash;and vowing that&mdash;you&mdash;shall take that daughter
of her own&mdash;that loathsome Lena&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Indeed!&mdash;And you can hear it in the helmet?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. I can.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. I didn't know of that. But my godmother gave me the helmet as a
christening present.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. Give me a feather, will you?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. It is a pleasure&mdash;great as life itself.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. But you must cut it so that it will write.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. You know a thing or two!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. My father taught me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span> <i>pulls a black feather out of the plume on his
helmet; then he takes a silver-handled knife from his belt and
cuts the quill</i>.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span> <i>takes out an ink-well and parchment from a drawer in
the table</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Who is Lady Lena?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. You mean, what kind of person? You want her, do you?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Some evil things are brewing in this house&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. Fear not! My father has bestowed a gift on me that will
bring help in hours of need.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. What is it called?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. It is the horn Stand-By.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Where is it hid?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. Read in my eye. I dare not let the maids discover it.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. [<i>Gazing at her eyes</i>] I see!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. [<i>Pushing pen, ink and parchment across the table to the</i>
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>] Write it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span> <i>writes</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. Yes, that's the place. [<i>She writes again.</i></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. What do you write?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. Names&mdash;all pretty names that may be worn by princes!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Except my own!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. Yours, too!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Leave that alone!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. Here I have written twenty names&mdash;all that I know&mdash;and
so your name must be there, too. [<i>Pushing the parchment across the
table</i>] Read!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span> <i>reads</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. Oh, I have read it in your eye!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Don't utter it! I beg you in the name of God the merciful,
don't utter it!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. I read it in his eye!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. But do not utter it, I beg of you!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. And if I do? What then?&mdash;Can Lena tell, you think? Your
bride! Your love!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Oh, hush, hush, hush!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. [<i>Jumps up and begins to dance</i>] I know his name&mdash;the
prettiest name in all the land!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span> <i>runs up to her, catches hold of her and covers
her mouth with his hand</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. I'll bite your hand; I'll suck your blood; and so I'll be
your sister twice&mdash;do you know what that can mean?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. I'll have two sisters then.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. [<i>Throwing back her head</i>] O-ho! O-ho! Behold, the
ceiling has a hole, and I can see the sky&mdash;a tiny piece of sky, a
window-pane&mdash;and there's a face behind it. Is it an angel's?&mdash;See&mdash;but
see, I tell you!&mdash;It's your face!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. The angels are not boys, but girls.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. But it is you.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. [<i>Looking up</i>] 'Tis a mirror.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. Woe to us then! It is the witching mirror of my stepmother,
and she has seen it all.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. And in the mirror I can see the fireplace&mdash;there's a pumpkin
hanging in it!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. [<i>Takes from the fireplace a mottled, strangely shaped
pumpkin</i>] What can it be? It has the look of an ear. The witch has
heard us, too!&mdash;Alas, alas! [<i>She throws the pumpkin into the fireplace
and runs across the floor toward the bed; suddenly she stops on one
foot, holding up the other</i>]</p>

<p>Oh, she has strewn the floor with needles&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>[<i>She sits down and begins to rub her foot</i>.</p></blockquote>

her</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. No, you mustn't touch my foot&mdash;you mustn't!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Dear heart, you must take off your stocking if I am to help.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. [<i>Sobbing</i>] You mustn't&mdash;mustn't see my foot!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. But why? Why shouldn't I?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. I cannot tell; I cannot tell. Go&mdash;go away from me! To-morrow
I shall tell you, but I can't to-day.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. But then your little foot will suffer&mdash;let me pull the needle
out!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. Go, go, go!&mdash;No, no, you mustn't try!&mdash;Oh, had my mother
lived, a thing like this could not have happened!&mdash;Mother, mother,
mother!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. I cannot understand&mdash;are you afraid of me&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. Don't ask me, please&mdash;just leave me&mdash;oh!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. What have I done?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. Don't leave me, please&mdash;I didn't mean to hurt you&mdash;but I
cannot tell&mdash;If I could only reach the shore&mdash;the white sand of the
beach&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. What then?</p>

notice it before.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. Nor I! How did it get there? When?&mdash;But all the same it

listen, Prince: how would like to sleep in our Blue Room?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. Look, look! The cruel one is smiling as at some memory from
childhood days. See how Signe the False seems faith and hope embodied,
how the ugly Tova has grown beautiful, the little Elsa tall.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Our love has done it.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. So that is love? Blessed be it by the Lord! The Lord
Omnipotent who made the world!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Come to my arms and you will smile.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. There I should die, I think.</p>

<p><i>The maids wake up</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STEPMOTHER</span>. Show the prince the shortest way to the Blue Tower. And
should he nevertheless lose his way, you may summon the Castellan and
the Gaoler, the Equerry and the Constable.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. No need of that! Wherever leads my course&mdash;through fire or
water, up above the clouds or down in the solid earth&mdash;there shall I
meet my Swanwhite, for she is with me where I go. So now I go to meet
her&mdash;in the tower! Can you beat that for witchcraft, witch?&mdash;Too hard,
I think, for one who knows not love!</p>

wishes&mdash;but be brief!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. My foremost, highest wish is for some water with which to
lave my feet.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STEPMOTHER</span>. Cold or warm?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. Warm&mdash;if I may.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STEPMOTHER</span>. What more?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. A comb to ravel out my hair.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STEPMOTHER</span>. Silver or gold?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. Are you&mdash;are you kind?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STEPMOTHER</span>. Silver or gold?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. Wood or horn will do me well enough.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STEPMOTHER</span>. What more?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. A shift that's clean.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STEPMOTHER</span>. Linen or silk?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. Just linen.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STEPMOTHER</span>. Good! So I have heard your wishes. Now listen to mine! I
wish that you may have no water, be it warm or cold! I wish that you
may have no comb, of any kind, not even of wood or horn&mdash;much less of
gold or silver. That's how kind I am! I wish that you may wear no linen
&mdash;but get you at once into the closet there to cover up your body with
that dingy sark of homespun! Such is my word!&mdash;And if you try to leave
these rooms&mdash;which you had better not, as there are traps and snares
around&mdash;then you are doomed&mdash;or with my whip I'll mark your pretty
face so that no prince or king will ever look at you again!&mdash;Then get
yourself to bed!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span> <i>is lying on the bed; she has on a garment of black
homespun</i>.</p>

<p><i>The doors to the three closets are open. In each doorway
stands one of the maids, her eyes closed and in one of her
hands a small lighted lamp of Roman pattern</i>.</p>

<p><i>A swan is seen flying above the rosery, and trumpet-calls are
heard, like those made by flocks of migrating wild swans</i>.</p>

<p><i>The</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MOTHER OF SWANWHITE</span>, <i>all in white, appears outside the
gates. Over one arm she carries the plumage of a swan and on
the other one a small harp of gold. She hangs the plumage on
one of the gates, which opens of its own accord and then closes
in the same way behind her</i>.</p>

<p><i>She enters the room and places the harp on the table. Then she
looks around and becomes aware of</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. <i>At once the harp
begins to play. The lamps carried by the maids go out one by
one, beginning with that farthest away. Then the three doors
close one by one, beginning with the innermost</i>.</p>

<p><i>The golden clouds resume their former radiance</i>.</p>

<p><i>The</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MOTHER</span> <i>lights one of the lamps on the stand and goes up
to the bed, beside which she kneels</i>.</p>

<p><i>The harp continues to play during the ensuing episode</i>.</p>

<p><i>The</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MOTHER</span> <i>rises, takes</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span> <i>in her arms, and places
her, still sleeping, in a huge arm-chair. Then she kneels down
and pulls off</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE'S</span> <i>stockings. Having thrown these
under the bed, she bends over her daughter's feet as if to
moisten them with her tears. After a while she wipes them with
a white linen cloth and covers them with kisses. Finally she
puts a sandal on each foot which then appears shining white</i>.</p>

<p><i>Then the</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MOTHER</span> <i>rises to her feet again, takes out a comb of
gold, and begins to comb</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE'S</span> <i>hair. This finished, she
carries</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span> <i>back to the bed. Beside her she places a
garment of white linen which she takes out of a bag</i>.</p>

<p><i>Having kissed</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span> <i>on the forehead, she prepares to
leave. At that moment a white swan is seen to pass by outside,
and one hears a trumpet-call like the one heard before. Shortly
afterward the</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MOTHER OF THE PRINCE</span>, <i>also in white, enters
through the gate, having first hung her swan plumage on it</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE'S MOTHER</span>. Well met, my sister! How long before the cock will
crow?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE'S MOTHER</span>. Not very long. The dew is rising from the roses, the
corn-crake's call is heard among the grass, the morning breeze is
coming from the sea.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE'S MOTHER</span>. Let us make haste with what we have on hand, my
sister.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE'S MOTHER</span>. You called me so that we might talk of our children.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE'S MOTHER</span>. Once I was walking in a green field in the land
that knows no sorrow. There I met you, whom I had always known, yet
had not seen before. You were lamenting your poor boy's fate, left to
himself here in the vale of sorrow. You opened up your heart to me, and
my own thoughts, that dwell unwillingly below, were sent in search of
my deserted daughter&mdash;destined to marry the young king, who is a cruel
man, and evil.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE'S MOTHER</span>. Then I spoke, while you listened: "May worth belong to
worth; may love, the powerful, prevail; and let us join these lonely
hearts, in order that they may console each other!"</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE'S MOTHER</span>. Since then heart has kissed heart and soul enfolded
soul. May sorrow turn to joy, and may their youthful happiness bring
cheer to all the earth!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE'S MOTHER</span>. If it be granted by the powers on high!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE'S MOTHER</span>. That must be tested by the fire of suffering.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE'S MOTHER</span>. [<i>Taking in her hand the helmet left behind by the</i>
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>] May sorrow turn to joy&mdash;this very day, when he has mourned his
mother one whole year!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>She exchanges the black feathers on the helmet for white and
red ones</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE'S MOTHER</span>. Your hand, my sister&mdash;let the test begin!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE'S MOTHER</span>. Here is my hand, and with it goes my son's! Now we
have pledged them&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE'S MOTHER</span>. In decency and honour!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE'S MOTHER</span>. I go to open up the tower. And let the young ones fold
each other heart to heart.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE'S MOTHER</span>. In decency and honour!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE'S MOTHER</span>. And we shall meet again in those green fields where
sorrow is not known.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE'S MOTHER</span>. [<i>Pointing to</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>] Listen! She dreams
of him!&mdash;Oh foolish, cruel woman who thinks that lovers can be
parted!&mdash;Now they are walking hand in hand within the land of dreams,
'neath whispering firs and singing lindens&mdash;They sport and laugh&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE'S MOTHER</span>. Hush! Day is dawning&mdash;I can hear the robins calling,
and see the stars withdrawing from the sky&mdash;Farewell, my sister!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>She goes out, taking her swan plumage with her.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE'S MOTHER</span>. Farewell!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>She passes her hand over</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span> <i>as if blessing her, then
she takes her plumage and leaves, closing the gate after her</i>.</p>

<p><i>The clock on the table strikes three. The harp is silent for
a moment; then it begins to play a new melody of even greater
sweetness than before</i>. <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span> <i>wakes up and looks around;
listens to the harp; gets up from the bed; draws her hands
through her hair; looks with pleasure at her own little feet,
now spotlessly clean, and notices finally the while linen
garment on the bed. She sits down at the table in the place she
occupied during the evening. She acts as if she were looking at
somebody sitting opposite her at the table, where the</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>
<i>was seated the night before. She looks straight into his eyes,
smiles a smile of recognition, and holds out one of her hands.
Her lips move at times as if she were speaking, and then again
she seems to be listening to an answer</i>.</p>

<p><i>She points meaningly to the white and red feathers on the
helmet, and leans forward as if whispering. Then she puts her
head back and breathes deeply as if to fill her nostrils with
some fragrance. Having caught something in the air with one
of her hands, she kisses the hand and then pretends to throw
something back across the table. She picks up the quill and
caresses it as if it were a bird; then she writes and pushes
the parchment across the table. Her glances seem to follow
"his" pen while the reply is being written, and at last she
takes back the parchment, reads it, and hides it in her bosom</i>.</p>

<p><i>She strokes her black dress as if commenting on the sad change
in her appearance. Whereupon she smiles at an inaudible answer,
and finally bursts into hearty laughter</i>.</p>

<p><i>By gestures she indicates that her hair has been combed. Then
she rises, goes a little distance away from the table, and
turns around with a bashful expression to hold out one of her
feet. In that attitude she stays for a moment while waiting for
an answer. On hearing it she becomes embarrassed and hides her
foot quickly under her dress</i>.</p>

<p><i>She goes to the chest and takes out the chess-board and the
chess-men, which she places on the lions skin with a gesture of
invitation. Then she lies down beside the board, arranges the
men, and begins to play with an invisible partner</i>.</p>

<p><i>The harp is silent for a moment before it starts a new melody</i>.</p>

<p><i>The game of chess ends and</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span> <i>seems to be talking
with her invisible partner. Suddenly she moves away as if
he were coming too close to her. With a deprecating gesture
she leaps lightly to her feet. Then she gazes long and
reproachfully at him. At last she snatches up the white garment
and hides herself behind the bed</i>.</p>

<p><i>At that moment the</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span> <i>appears outside the gates, which
he vainly tries to open. Then he raises his eyes toward the sky
with an expression of sorrow and despair</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. [<i>Coming forward</i>] Who comes with the morning wind?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Your heart's beloved, your prince, your all!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. Whence do you come, my heart's beloved?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. From dreamland; from the rosy hills that hide the dawn; from
whispering firs and singing lindens.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. What did you do in dreamland, beyond the hills of dawn, my
heart's beloved?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. I sported and laughed; I wrote her name; I sat upon the lion's
skin and played at chess.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. You sported and you played&mdash;with whom?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. With Swanwhite.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. It is he!&mdash;Be welcome to my castle, my table, and my arms!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Who opens up the golden gates?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. Give me your hand!&mdash;It is as chilly as your heart is warm.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. My body has been sleeping in the tower, while my soul was
wandering in dreamland&mdash;In the tower it was cold and dark.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. In my bosom will I warm your hand&mdash;I'll warm it by my
glances, by my kisses!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Oh, let the brightness of your eyes be shed upon my darkness!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. Are you in darkness?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Within the tower there was no light of sun or moon.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. Rise up, O sun! Blow, southern wind! And let thy bosom
gently heave, O sea!&mdash;Ye golden gates, do you believe that you can part
two hearts, two hands, two lips&mdash;that can by nothing be divided?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Indeed, by nothing!</p>

punished us?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. I am not parted from you, my beloved, for still the sound of my
voice can reach you. It goes through copper, steel, and stone to touch
your ear in sweet caress. When in my thoughts you're in my arms. I
kiss you in my dreams. For on this earth there is not anything that can
part us. Swanwhite. Not anything!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. I see you, though my eyes cannot behold you. I taste you, too,
because with roses you are filling up my mouth&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. But in my arms I want you!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. I am there.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">GARDENER</span>. I sow, I sow!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. What do you sow?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">GARDENER</span>. Seeds, seeds, seeds.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. What kind of seeds?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">GARDENER</span>. Annuals and biennials. One pulls this way, two pull that.
When the bridal suit is on, the harmony is gone. One and one make one,
but one and one make also three. One and one make two, but two make
three. Then do you understand?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. You mole, you earthworm, you who turn your forehead toward the
ground and show the sky your back&mdash;what is there you can teach me?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">GARDENER</span>. That you are a mole and earthworm, too. And that because you
turn your back on the earth, the earth will turn its back on you. [<i>He
disappears behind the table</i>.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. What was it? Who was he?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. That was the green gardener.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. Green, you say? Was he not blue?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. No, he was green, my love.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. How can you say what is not so?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. My heart's beloved, I have not said a thing that was not so.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. Alas, he does not speak the truth!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Whose voice is this? Not that of Swanwhite!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. Who is this my eyes behold? Not my Prince, whose very name
attracted me like music of the Neck, or song of mermaids heard among
green waves&mdash;Who are you? You stranger with the evil eyes&mdash;and with
grey hair!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. You did not see it until now&mdash;my hair, that turned to grey
within the tower, in a single night, when I was mourning for my
Swanwhite, who is no longer here.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. Yes, here is Swanwhite.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. No, I see a black-clad maid, whose face is black&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. Have you not seen before that I was clad in black? You do
not love me, then!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. You who are standing there, so grim and ugly&mdash;no!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. Then you have spoken falsely.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">PRINCE</span>. No&mdash;for then another one was here! Now&mdash;you are filling up my
mouth with noisome nettles.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. Your violets smell of henbane now&mdash;faugh!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Thus I am punished for my treason to the king!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. I wish that I had waited for your king!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Just wait, and he will come.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. I will not wait, but go to meet him.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Then I will stay.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. [<i>Going toward the background</i>] And this is love!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. [<i>Beside himself</i>] Where is my Swanwhite? Where, where, where?
The kindest, loveliest, most beautiful?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. Seek her!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. 'Twould not avail me here below.</p>

<p><i>The</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span> <i>is alone. He sits down at the table, covers his

the room and sets draperies and curtains fluttering. A sound as
of a sigh is heard from the strings of the harp. The</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>
<i>rises, goes to the bed, and stands there lost in contemplation
of its pillow in which is a depression showing</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE'S</span>

you slept?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Where is Swanwhite?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STEPMOTHER</span>. She has gone to marry her young king. Is there no thought
of things like that in your own mind, my Prince?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. I harbour but a single thought&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STEPMOTHER</span>. Of little Swanwhite?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. She is too young for me, you mean?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STEPMOTHER</span>. Grey hairs and common sense belong together as a rule&mdash;I
have a girl with common sense&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. And I grey hairs?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STEPMOTHER</span>. He knows it not, believes it not! Come, maids! Come, Signe,
Elsa, Tova! Let's have a good laugh at the young suitor and his grey
hairs!</p>

<p>[<i>She hands him a parchment covered with writing</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. [<i>Reading</i>] And she wrote this?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STEPMOTHER</span>. You know her hand&mdash;what has it written?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. That she hates me, and loves another&mdash;that she has played with
me; that she will throw my kisses to the wind, and to the swine my
heart&mdash;To die is now my will! Now I am dead!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STEPMOTHER</span>. A knight dies not because a wench has played with him. He
shows himself a man and takes another.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Another? When there is only one?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STEPMOTHER</span>. No, two, at least! My Magdalene possesses seven barrels
full of gold.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Seven?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STEPMOTHER</span>. And more. [<i>Pause</i>.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Where is Swanwhite?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STEPMOTHER</span>. My Magdalene is skilled in many crafts&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Including witchcraft?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STEPMOTHER</span>. She knows how to bewitch a princeling.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. [<i>Gazing at the parchment</i>] And this was written by my
Swanwhite?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STEPMOTHER</span>. My Magdalene would never write like that.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. And she is kind?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STEPMOTHER</span>. Kindness itself! She does not play with sacred feelings,
nor seek revenge for little wrongs, and she is faithful to the one she
likes.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Then she must be beautiful.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STEPMOTHER</span>. Not beautiful!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. She is not kind then.&mdash;Tell me more of her!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STEPMOTHER</span>. See for yourself.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STEPMOTHER</span>. Here.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. And this has Swanwhite written&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STEPMOTHER</span>. My Magdalene had written with more feeling</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. What would she have written?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STEPMOTHER</span>. That&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Speak the word! Say "love," if you are able!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STEPMOTHER</span>. Lub!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. You cannot speak the word!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STEPMOTHER</span>. Lud!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Oh, no!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STEPMOTHER</span>. My Magdalene can speak it. May she come?</p>

his love, he started to swim back, in face of tide and wave and
wind&mdash;because his bark seemed rudder-less.&mdash;I saw his young head breast
the billows, I heard him cry her name&mdash;and then his corpse was gently
dropped upon the white sand at my feet. His hair had turned to grey
that night when he slept in the tower; sorrow and wrath had blanched
his cheeks; his lips had lost their power of smiling.&mdash;Now, when
death o'ertook him, beauty and youth came with it. Like wreaths his
darkening locks fell round his rosy cheeks; he smiled&mdash;and see!&mdash;is
smiling still. The people gathered on the shore, awed by the gentle
spectacle&mdash;and man said unto man: lo, this is love!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SWANWHITE</span>. [<i>Lying down beside the body of the</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>] He's dead; his
heart will sing no more; his eyes no longer will light up my life;

me&mdash;toward heaven he smiles. And on his journey I shall bear him
company.</p>

that?</p>

that!&mdash;But, child, then it must also have the power to make the dead
return out of the darkling realms of death!&mdash;I cannot do it, having not
received the grace of love. But you!</p>

Lady Almighty, you can do anything!&mdash;Be taught by me who have no power
at all. Go, cry the name of your beloved, and put your hand above his
heart! Then, with the help of the Supreme One&mdash;calling none but Him for
helper&mdash;your beloved will hear your voice&mdash;if you believe!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">BISKRA</span>. LÃ¢ ilÃ¢hÃ¢ illÃ¢ 'llÃ¢h!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">YUSUF</span>. [<i>Enters quickly</i>] The Simoom is coming! Where is the Frank?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">BISKRA</span>. He'll be here in a moment.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">YUSUF</span>. Why didn't you stab him when you had a chance?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">BISKRA</span>. Because he is to do it himself. If I were to do it, our whole
tribe would be killed, for I am known to the Franks as Ali, the guide,
though they don't know me as Biskra, the maiden.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">YUSUF</span>. He is to do it himself, you say? How is that to happen?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">BISKRA</span>. Don't you know that the Simoom makes the brains of the white
people dry as dates, so that they have horrible visions which disgust
them with life and cause them to flee into the great unknown?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">YUSUF</span>. I have heard of such things, and in the last battle there were
six Franks who took their own lives before the fighting began. But do
not place your trust in the Simoom to-day, for snow has fallen in the
mountains, and the storm may be all over in half an hour.&mdash;Biskra! Do
you still know how to hate?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">BISKRA</span>. If I know how to hate?&mdash;My hatred is boundless as the desert,
burning as the sun, and stronger than my love. Every hour of joy that
has been stolen from me since the murder of Ali has been stored up
within me like the venom back of a viper's tooth, and what the Simoom
cannot do, that I can do.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">YUSUF</span>. Well spoken, Biskra, and the task shall be yours. Ever since my
eyes first fell upon you, my own hatred has been withering like alfa
grass in the autumn. Take strength from me and become the arrow to my
bow.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">BISKRA</span>. Embrace me, Yusuf, embrace me!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">YUSUF</span>. Not here, within the presence of the Sainted one; not
now&mdash;later, afterward, when you have earned your reward!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">BISKRA</span>. You proud sheikh! You man of pride!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">YUSUF</span>. Yes&mdash;the maiden who is to carry my offspring under her heart
must show herself worthy of the honour.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">BISKRA</span>. I&mdash;no one but I&mdash;shall bear the offspring of Yusuf! I,
Biskra&mdash;the scorned one, the ugly one, but the strong one, too!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">YUSUF</span>. All right! I am now going to sleep beside the spring.&mdash;Do I
need to teach you more of the secret arts which you learned from
Sidi-Sheikh, the great marabout, and which you have practised at fairs
ever since you were a child?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">BISKRA</span>. Of that there is no need. I know all the secrets needed to
scare the life out of a cowardly Frank.&mdash;The dastard who sneaks upon
the enemy and sends the leaden bullet ahead of himself! I know them
all&mdash;even the art of letting my voice come out of my belly. And what is
beyond my art, that will be done by the sun, for the sun is on the side
of Yusuf and Biskra.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">YUSUF</span>. The sun is a friend of the Moslem, but not to be relied upon.
You may get burned, girl!&mdash;Take a drink of water first of all, for I
see that your hands are shrivelled, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">BISKRA</span>. Of course!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">GUIMARD</span>. I thought so. Give me a stool now&mdash;under my head.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">GUIMARD</span>. What dog? I have never been bitten by a dog.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">BISKRA</span>. The Simoom has shrivelled up your memory&mdash;beware the delusions
of the Simoom! Don't you remember the mad greyhound that bit you during
the last hunt at Bab-el-Wad?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">GUIMARD</span>. The hunt at Bab-el-Wad? That's right!&mdash;Was it a
beaver-coloured&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">BISKRA</span>. Bitch? Yes.&mdash;There you see. And she bit you in the calf. Can't
you feel the sting of the wound?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">GUIMARD</span>. [<i>Reaches out a hand to feel his calf and pricks himself on

the help of music, which is all-powerful. Listen!</p>

could it help me?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">BISKRA</span>. If music can tame the treacherous spirit of the snake, don't

sight and thought, you must believe in me&mdash;believe what I say and do
what I tell you.</p>

<p><i>A well-furnished hotel room. There are doors on both sides</i>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">FIRST SCENE</p>


<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">THURE</span> <i>and his</i> <span class="small-c">WIFE</span>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">THURE</span>. There's some style to this room, isn't there? But then the
fellow who lives here is stylish, too.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. Yes, so I understand. Of course, I've never seen your brother,
but I've heard a whole lot.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THURE</span>. Oh, gossip! <i>My</i> brother, the doctor, has gone right across
Africa, and that's something everybody can't do. So it doesn't matter
how many drinks he took as a young chap&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. Yes, your brother, the doctor! Who is nothing but a
school-teacher, for that matter&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THURE</span>. No, he's a doctor of philosophy, I tell you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. Well, that's nothing but one who teaches. And that's just what my
brother is doing in the school at Ã…by.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THURE</span>. Your brother is all right, but he is nothing but a public-school
teacher, and that's not the same as a doctor of philosophy&mdash;which isn't
a boast either.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. Well, no matter what he is or what you call him, he has cost us a
whole lot.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THURE</span>. Of course it has been rather costly, but then he has brought us
a lot of pleasure, too.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. Fine pleasures! When we've got to lose house and home for his
sake!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THURE</span>. That's so&mdash;but then we don't know yet if his slip-up on the loan
had some kind of cause that he couldn't help. I guess it isn't so easy
to send registered letters from darkest Africa.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. Whether he has any excuses or not doesn't change the matter a
bit. But if he wants to do something for us&mdash;it's nothing more than he
owes us.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THURE</span>. Well, we'll see, we'll see!&mdash;Anyhow, have you heard they've
already given him four decorations?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. Well, that doesn't help us any. I guess it'll only make him a
little more stuck-up. Oh, no, it'll be some time before I get over that
the sheriff had to come down on us with the papers&mdash;and bring in other
people as witnesses&mdash;and then&mdash;the auction&mdash;and all the neighbours
coming in and turning all we had upside down. And do you know what made
me sorer than all the rest?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THURE</span>. The black&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. Yes, it was that my sister-in-law should bid in my black silk
dress for fifteen crowns. Think of it&mdash;fifteen crowns!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THURE</span>. You just wait&mdash;just wait a little! We might get you a new silk
dress&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. [<i>Weeping</i>] But it'll never be the same one&mdash;the one my
sister-in-law bid in.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THURE</span>. We'll get another one then!&mdash;Now, just look at that gorgeous hat
over there! I guess it must be one of those royal chamberlains who's
talking with Axel now.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. What do I care about that!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THURE</span>. Why, don't you think it's fun that a fellow who has the same
name as you and I gets to be so respected that the King's own household
people have to visit him? If I remember right, you were happy for a
whole fortnight when your brother, the school-teacher, had been asked
to dine at the bishop's.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. I can't remember anything of the kind.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THURE</span>. Of course you can't!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. But I do remember the fifteenth of March, when we had to leave
our place for his sake, and we hadn't been married more than two years,
and I had to carry away the child on my own arm&mdash;Oh!&mdash;and then, when
the steamer came with all the passengers on board just as we had to get
out&mdash;all the cocked hats in the world can't make me forget that! And,
for that matter, what do you think a royal chamberlain cares about a
plain gardener and his wife when they've just been turned out of house
and home?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THURE</span>. Look here! What do you think this is? Look at all his
decorations!&mdash;Look at this one, will you!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>He takes an order out of its case, holds it in the palm of his
hand, and pats it as if it were a living thing</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. Oh, that silly stuff!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THURE</span>. Don't you say anything against them, for you never can tell
where you'll end. The gardener at Staring was made a director and a
knight on the same day.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. Well, what does that help us?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THURE</span>. No, of course not&mdash;it doesn't help us&mdash;but these things here
[<i>pointing to the orders</i>] may help us a whole lot in getting another
place.&mdash;However, I think we've waited quite a while now, so we'd better
sit down and make ourselves at home. Let me help you off with your
coat&mdash;come on now!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. [<i>After a slight resistance</i>] So you think we're going to be
welcome, then? I have a feeling that our stay here won't last very long.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THURE</span>. Tut, tut! And I think we're going to have a good dinner, too, if
I know Axel right. If he only knew that we're here&mdash;But now you'll
see! [<i>He presses a button and a</i> <span class="small-c">WAITER</span> <i>enters</i>] What do you want&mdash;a
sandwich, perhaps? [<i>To the</i> <span class="small-c">WAITER</span>] Bring us some sandwiches and
beer.&mdash;Wait a moment! Get a drink for me&mdash;the real stuff, you know!
[<i>The</i> <span class="small-c">WAITER</span> <i>goes out</i>] You've got to take care of yourself, don't
you know.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"> SECOND SCENE</p>


<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">THURE</span> <i>and his</i> <span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. <span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. The <span class="small-c">CHAMBERLAIN</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. [<i>To the</i> <span class="small-c">CHAMBERLAIN</span>] At five, then&mdash;in full dress, I suppose?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CHAMBERLAIN</span>. And your orders!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. Is it necessary?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CHAMBERLAIN</span>. Absolutely necessary, if you don't want to seem rude, and
that's something which you, as a democrat, want least of all. Good-bye,
doctor!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. Good-bye.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>In leaving, the</i> <span class="small-c">CHAMBERLAIN</span> <i>bows slightly to</i> <span class="small-c">THURE</span> <i>and
his</i> <span class="small-c">WIFE</span>, <i>neither of whom returns the salute</i>.</p></blockquote>

<hr class="r5" />

<p style="text-align: center;"> THIRD SCENE</p>


<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. <span class="small-c">THURE</span> <i>and his</i> <span class="small-c">WIFE</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. Oh, is that you, old boy?&mdash;It seems an eternity since I saw you
last. And this is your wife?&mdash;Glad to see you!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THURE</span>. Thanks, brother! And I wish you a happy return after your long
trip.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. Yes, that was something of a trip&mdash;I suppose you have read about
it in the papers&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THURE</span>. Oh, yes, I've read all about it. [<i>Pause</i>] And then father sent
you his regards.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. Oh, is he still sore at me?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THURE</span>. Well, you know the old man and his ways. If only you hadn't been
a member of that expedition, you know, he would have thought it one of
the seven wonders of the world. But as you were along, of course, it
was nothing but humbug.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. So he's just the same as ever! Simply because I am <i>his</i> son,
nothing I ever do can be of any value. It means he can't think very
much of himself either.&mdash;Well, so much for that! And how are you
getting along nowadays?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THURE</span>. Not very well, exactly! There's that old loan from the bank, you
know&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. Yes, that's right! Well, what happened to it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THURE</span>. Oh, what happened was that I had to pay it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. That's too bad! But we'll settle the matter as soon as we have a
chance.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">WAITER</span> <i>comes in with</i> <span class="small-c">THURE</span>'s <i>order on a tray</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. What's that?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THURE</span>. Oh, it was only me who took the liberty of ordering a couple of
sandwiches&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. Right you were! But I think we ought to have some wine, so I
could drink the health of my sister-in-law, as I couldn't get to the
wedding.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THURE</span>. Oh, no&mdash;not for us! Not so early in the morning! Thanks very
much!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. [<i>Signals to the</i> <span class="small-c">WAITER</span>, <i>who goes out</i>] I should have asked you
to stay for dinner, but I have to go out myself. Can you guess where I
am going?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THURE</span>. You don't mean to say you're going to the Palace?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. Exactly&mdash;I am asked to meet the Monarch himself.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THURE</span>. Lord preserve us!&mdash;What do you think of that, Anna?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>His</i> <span class="small-c">WIFE</span> <i>turns and twists on her chair as if in torment,
quite unable to answer</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. I suppose the old man will turn republican after this, when he
hears that His Majesty cares to associate with me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THURE</span>. See here, Axel&mdash;you'll have to pardon me for getting back to
something that's not very pleasant&mdash;but it has to be settled.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. Is it that blessed old loan?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THURE</span>. Yes, but it isn't only that. To put it plain&mdash;we've had to stand
an execution for your sake, and now we're absolutely cleaned out.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. That's a fine state of affairs! But why in the world didn't you
get the loan renewed?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THURE</span>. Well, that's it! How was I to get any new sureties when you were
away?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. Couldn't you go to my friends?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THURE</span>. I did. And the result was&mdash;what it was. Can you help us out now?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. How am I going to help you now? Now when all my creditors are
getting after me? And it won't do for me to start borrowing when they
are just about to make a position for me. There's nothing that hurts
you more than to borrow money. Just wait a little while, and we'll get
it all straightened out.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THURE</span>. If we're to wait, then everything's up with us. This is just the
time to get hold of a garden&mdash;this is the time to start digging and
sowing, if you are to get anything up in time. Can't you get a place
for us?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. Where am I to get hold of a garden?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THURE</span>. Among your friends.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. My friends keep no gardens. Now, don't you hamper me when I try
to get up on firm ground! When I am there I'll pull you up, too.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THURE</span>. [<i>To his</i> <span class="small-c">WIFE</span>] He doesn't want to help us, Anna!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. I cannot&mdash;not this moment! Do you think it reasonable that I, who
am seeking a job myself, should have to seek one for you, too? What
would people be saying, do you think? "There, now," they would say,
"we've got not only him but his relatives to look after!" And then they
would drop me entirely.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THURE</span>. [<i>Looks at his watch; then to his wife</i>] We've got to go.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. Why must you go so soon?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THURE</span>. We have to take the child to a doctor.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. For the Lord's sake, have you a child, too?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. Yes, we have. And a sick child, which lost its health when we had
to move out into the kitchen so that the auction could be held.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. And all this for my sake! It's enough to drive me crazy! For
my sake! So that I might become a famous man!&mdash;And what is there I
can do for you?&mdash;Do you think it would have been better if I had
stayed at home?&mdash;No, worse&mdash;for then I should have been nothing but
a poor teacher, who certainly could not have been of any use to you
whatever.&mdash;Listen, now! You go to the doctor, but come back here after
a while. In the meantime I'll think out something.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THURE</span>. [<i>To his</i> <span class="small-c">WIFE</span>] Do you see now, that he wants to help us?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. Yes, but can he do it? That's the question.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THURE</span>. He can do anything he wants.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. Don't rely too much on it&mdash;or the last state may prove worse
than the first.&mdash;Oh, merciful heavens, to think that you have a sick
child, too! And for my sake!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THURE</span>. Oh, I guess it isn't quite as bad as it sounds.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. Yes, so you say, who don't know anything about it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THURE</span>. Well, Axel, we'll see you later then.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LINDGREN</span> <i>appears in the doorway</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">THURE</span>] Did you notice he didn't introduce us&mdash;to the
chamberlain?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THURE</span>. Oh, shucks, what good would that have been?</p>

<p>[<i>They go out</i>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"> FOURTH SCENE</p>


<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. LINDGREN, <i>who is shabbily dressed, unshaved, apparently
fond of drinking, and looking as if he had just got out of bed</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span> <i>is startled for a moment at the sight of</i> <span class="small-c">LINDGREN</span>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LINDGREN</span>. You don't recognise me?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. Yes, now I do. But you have changed a great deal.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LINDGREN</span>. Oh, you think so?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. Yes, I do, and I am surprised to find that these years can have
had such an effect&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LINDGREN</span>. Three years may be pretty long.&mdash;And you don't ask me to sit
down?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. Please&mdash;but I am rather in a hurry.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LINDGREN</span>. You have always been in a hurry.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>He sits down; pause.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. Why don't you say something unpleasant?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LINDGREN</span>. It's coming, it's coming!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>He wipes his spectacles; pause.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. How much do you need?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LINDGREN</span>. Three hundred and fifty.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. I haven't got it, and I can't get it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LINDGREN</span>. Oh, sure!&mdash;You don't mind if I help myself to a few drops?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>He pours out a drink from the bottle brought by the</i> <span class="small-c">WAITER</span>
<i>for</i> <span class="small-c">THURE</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. Won't you have a glass of wine with me instead?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LINDGREN</span>. No&mdash;why?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. Because it looks bad to be swilling whisky like that.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LINDGREN</span>. How very proper you have become!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. Not at all, but it hurts my reputation and my credit.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LINDGREN</span>. Oh, you have credit? Then you can also give me a lift, after
having brought me down.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. That is to say: you are making demands?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LINDGREN</span>. I am only reminding you that I am one of your victims.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. Then, because of the gratitude I owe you, I shall bring these
facts back to your mind: that you helped me through the university at
a time when you had plenty of money; that you helped to get my thesis
printed&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LINDGREN</span>. That I taught you the methods which determined your
scientific career; that I, who then was as straight as anybody,
exercised a favourable influence on your slovenly tendencies; that, in
a word, I made you what you are; and that, finally, when I applied for
an appropriation to undertake this expedition, you stepped in and took
it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. No, I got it. Because I, and not you, was held to be the man for
the task.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LINDGREN</span>. And that settled me! Thus, one shall be taken, and the other
left!&mdash;Do you think that was treating me fairly?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. It was what the world calls "ungrateful," but the task was
achieved, and by it science was enriched, the honour of our country
upheld, and new regions opened for the use of coming generations.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LINDGREN</span>. Here's to you!&mdash;You have had a lot of oratorical
practice&mdash;But have you any idea how unpleasant it feels to play the
part of one used up and cast off?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. I imagine it must feel very much like being conscious of
ingratitude, and I can only congratulate you at not finding yourself in
a position as unpleasant as my own.&mdash;But let us return to reality. What
can I do for you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LINDGREN</span>. What do you think?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. For the moment&mdash;nothing.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LINDGREN</span>. And in the next moment you are gone again. Which means that
this would be the last I saw of you.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>He pours out another drink</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. Will you do me the favour of not finishing the bottle? I don't
want the servants to suspect me of it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LINDGREN</span>. Oh, go to hell!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. You don't think it's pleasant for me to have to call you down
like this, do you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LINDGREN</span>. Say&mdash;do you want to get me a ticket for the banquet to-night?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. I am sorry to say that I don't think you would be admitted.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LINDGREN</span>. Because&mdash;-</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. You are drunk!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LINDGREN</span>. Thanks, old man!&mdash;Well, will you let me have a look at your
botanical specimens, then?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. No, I am going to describe them myself for the Academy.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LINDGREN</span>. How about your ethnographical stuff?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. No, that's not my own.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LINDGREN</span>. Will you&mdash;let me have twenty-five crowns?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. As I haven't more than twenty myself, I can only give you ten.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LINDGREN</span>. Rotten!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. Thus stand the affairs of the man everybody envies. Do you think
there is anybody in whose company I might feel happy? Not one! Those
that are still down hate me for climbing up, and those already up fear
one coming from below.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LINDGREN</span>. Yes, you are very unfortunate!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. I am! And I can tell you that after my experience during the last
half-hour, I wouldn't mind changing place with you. What a peaceful,
unassailable position he holds who has nothing to lose! What a lot
of interest and sympathy those that are obscure and misunderstood
and over-looked always arouse! You have only to hold out your hand
and you get a coin. You have only to open your arms, and there are
friends ready to fall into them. And then what a powerful party behind
you&mdash;formed of the millions who are just like you! You enviable man who
don't realise your own good fortune!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LINDGREN</span>. So you think me that far down, and yourself as high up as
all that?&mdash;Tell me, you don't happen to have read to-day's paper? [<i>He
takes a newspaper from his pocket</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. No, and I don't care to read it either.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LINDGREN</span>. But you ought to do it for your own sake.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. No, I am not going to do it&mdash;not even for <i>your</i> sake. It is as
if you said: "Come here and let me spit at you." And then you are silly
enough to demand that I shall come, too.&mdash;Do you know, during these
last minutes I have become more and more convinced that if I had ever
come across you in the jungle, I should beyond all doubt have picked
you off with my breech-loader?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LINDGREN</span>. I believe it&mdash;beast of prey that you are!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. It isn't safe to settle accounts with one's friends, or with
persons with whom one has been intimate, for it is hard to tell in
advance who has most on the debit side. But as you are bringing in
a bill, I am forced to look it over.&mdash;You don't think it took me
long to discover that back of all your generosity lay an unconscious
desire to turn me into the strong arm which you lacked&mdash;to make me
do for you what you couldn't do for yourself? I had imagination and
initiative&mdash;you had nothing but money and&mdash;"pull." So I am to be
congratulated that you didn't eat me, and I may be excused for eating
you&mdash;my only choice being to eat or be eaten!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LINDGREN</span>. You beast of prey!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. You rodent, who couldn't become a beast of prey&mdash;although that
was just what you wished! And what you want at this moment is not so
much to rise up to me as to pull me down to where you are.&mdash;If you
have anything of importance to add, you had better hurry up, for I am
expecting a visit.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LINDGREN</span>. From your fiancÃ©e?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. So you have snooped that out, too?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LINDGREN</span>. Sure enough! And I know what Marie, the deserted one, thinks
and says&mdash;I know what has happened to your brother and his wife&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. Oh, you know my fiancÃ©e? For, you see, it so happens that I am
not yet engaged!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LINDGREN</span>. No, but I know <i>her</i> fiancÃ©.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. What does that mean?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LINDGREN</span>. Why, she has been running around with another fellow all the
time&mdash;So you didn't know that?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. [<i>As he listens for something going on outside</i>] Oh, yes, I knew
of it, but I thought she was done with him&mdash;See here, if you'll come
back in a quarter of an hour, I'll try to get things arranged for you
in some way or another.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LINDGREN</span>. Is that a polite way of showing me the door?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. No, it's an attempt to meet an old obligation. Seriously!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LINDGREN</span>. Well, then I'll go&mdash;and come back&mdash;Good-bye for a while.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. With whom have I the honour&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FIANCÃ‰</span>. My name is not a name in the same way as yours, Doctor, and my
errand concerns a matter of the heart&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. Oh, do you happen to be&mdash;You know Miss Cecilia?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FIANCÃ‰</span>. I am the man.</p>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">WAITER</span> <i>enters</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. [<i>To the</i> <span class="small-c">WAITER</span>] Have my bill made out, see that my trunk is
packed, and bring me a carriage in half an hour.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WAITER</span>. [<i>Bowing and leaving</i>] Yes, Doctor.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. [<i>Goes up to the</i> <span class="small-c">FIANCÃ‰</span> <i>and sits down on a chair beside him</i>]
Now let's hear what you have to say?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FIANCÃ‰</span>. [<i>After a pause, with unction</i>] There were two men living in
the same city, one rich and the other poor. The rich man had sheep and
cattle in plenty. The poor man owned nothing but one ewe lamb&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. What does that concern me?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FIANCÃ‰</span>. [<i>As before</i>] One ewe lamb, which he had bought and was trying
to raise.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. Oh, life's too short. What do you want? Are you and Miss Cecilia
still engaged?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FIANCÃ‰</span>. [<i>Changing his tone</i>] I haven't said a word about Miss Cecilia,
have I?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. Well, sir, you had better get down to business, or I'll show you
the door. But be quick about it, and get straight to the point, without
any frills&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FIANCÃ‰</span>. [<i>Holding out his snuff-box</i>] May I?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. No, thanks.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FIANCÃ‰</span>. A great man like you has no such little weaknesses, I suppose?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. As you don't seem willing to speak, I shall. Of course, it is
none of your business, but it may do you good to learn of it, as you
don't seem to know it: I am regularly engaged to Miss Cecilia, who
formerly was your fiancÃ©e.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FIANCÃ‰</span>. [<i>Startled</i>] Who was?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. Because she has broken with you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FIANCÃ‰</span>. I know nothing about it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. [<i>Taking a ring from the pocket of his waistcoat]</i> That's
strange, but now you do know. And here you can see the ring she has
given me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FIANCÃ‰</span>. So she has broken with me?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. Yes, as she couldn't be engaged to two men at the same time, and
as she had ceased to care for you, she had to break with you. I might
have told you all this in a more decent fashion, if you hadn't stepped
on my corns the moment you came in.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FIANCÃ‰</span>. I didn't do anything of the kind.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. Cowardly and disingenuous&mdash;cringing and arrogant at the same time!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FIANCÃ‰</span>. [<i>Gently</i>] You are a hard man, Doctor.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. No, but I may become one. You showed no consideration for my
feelings a moment ago. You sneered, which I didn't. And that's the end
of our conversation.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FIANCÃ‰</span>. [<i>With genuine emotion</i>] I feared that you might take away from
me my only lamb&mdash;but you wouldn't do that, you who have so many&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. Suppose I wouldn't&mdash;are you sure she would stay with you anyhow?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FIANCÃ‰</span>. Put yourself in my place, Doctor&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. Yes, if you'll put yourself in mine.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FIANCÃ‰</span>. I am a poor man&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. So am I! But judging by what I see and hear, you have certain
bliss waiting for you in the beyond. That's more than I have.&mdash;And,
furthermore, I have taken nothing away from you: I have only received
what was offered me. Just as you did!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FIANCÃ‰</span>. And I who had been dreaming of a future for this young woman&mdash;a
future full of brightness&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. Pardon me a piece of rudeness, but you began it: are you so sure
that the future of this young woman will not turn out a great deal
brighter by my side?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FIANCÃ‰</span>. You are now reminding me of my humble position as a worker&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. No, I am reminding you of that young woman's future, which you
have so much at heart. And as I am told that she has ceased to care
for you, but does care for me, I am only taking the liberty to dream of
a brighter future for her with the man she loves than with the man she
doesn't love.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FIANCÃ‰</span>. You are a strong man, you are, and we little ones were born to
be your victims!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. See here, my man, I have been told that you got the better
of another rival for Cecilia's heart, and that you were not very
scrupulous about the means used for the purpose. How do you think that
<i>victim</i> liked you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FIANCÃ‰</span>. He was a worthless fellow.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. From whom you saved the girl! And now I save her from you!

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. <span class="small-c">CECILIA</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. That was a most unpleasant incident, which you might have spared
me&mdash;both by breaking openly with him and by not coming to my room.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CECILIA</span>. [<i>Weeping</i>] So I am to be scolded, too?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. Well, the responsibility had to be fixed, and now, when that's
done&mdash;we can talk of something else.&mdash;How are you, to begin with?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CECILIA</span>. So, so!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. Not well, that means?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CECILIA</span>. How are you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. Fine&mdash;only a little tired.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CECILIA</span>. Are you going with me to see my aunt this after-noon?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. No, I cannot, for I have to drive out.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CECILIA</span>. And that's more fun, of course. You go out such a lot, and
I&mdash;never!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. Hm!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CECILIA</span>. Why do you say "hm"?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. Because your remark made an unpleasant impression on me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CECILIA</span>. One gets so many unpleasant impressions these days&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. For instance?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CECILIA</span>. By reading the papers.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. So you have been reading those scandalous stories about me! And
you believe them?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CECILIA</span>. One doesn't know what to believe.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. So you really suspect me of being the unscrupulous fellow
pictured in those stories? And as you are nevertheless willing to marry
me, I must assume that you are moved by purely practical considerations
and not by any personal attraction.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CECILIA</span>. You speak so harshly, as if you didn't care for me at all!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. Cecilia&mdash;are you willing to leave this place with me in fifteen
minutes?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CECILIA</span>. In fifteen minutes! For where!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. London.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CECILIA</span>. I am not going with you until we are married.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. Why?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CECILIA</span>. Why should we leave like that, all of a sudden?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. Because&mdash;it's suffocating here! And if I stay, they'll drag me
down so deep that I'll never get up again.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CECILIA</span>. How strange! Are you as badly off as that?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. Do you come with me, or do you not?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CECILIA</span>. Not until we are married&mdash;for afterward you would never marry
me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. So that's your faith in me!&mdash;Will you sit down for a moment,
then, while I go in and write a couple of letters?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MARIE</span>. And now there is another one to be thrown on the scrap heap?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL</span>. Did I ever give you any promises that were not kept? Have I ever
owed you anything? Have I ever said a word about marriage? Have we had
any children together? Have I been the only one to receive your favours?</p>

that when we met in the streets we called each other by our first
names. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">AXEL</span>] And now you are going to marry her? No, you know,

himself for so little&mdash;[<i>Everybody cries out</i>] So you were no beast of
prey, my dear Axel!&mdash;But&mdash;[<i>He stares through the open door into the
adjoining room</i>]&mdash;he's not there&mdash;and his things are gone, too. So he
has skipped out! And the bottle has never been opened! That means&mdash;he
meant to kill himself, but changed his mind!&mdash;And these are his
posthumous writings. "To Miss Cecilia"&mdash;seems to contain some round
object&mdash;probably an engagement ring&mdash;there you are!&mdash;"To my brother

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. Oh, in that way!</p>

tell you, that fellow is a wonder at clearing up tangled affairs!&mdash;Of
course, it makes me mad to think that I let myself be fooled&mdash;but I'll
be darned if I don't think I would have done just as he did!&mdash;And so
would you, perhaps?&mdash;Or what do you think?</p>

<p><i>The background represents a vineyard. At the left stands a
mausoleum. It consists of a small whitewashed brick building
with a door and a pointed window that lacks mullions and panes.
The roof is made of red tiles. A cross crowns the gable.
Clematis vines with purple-coloured, cross-shaped flowers cover
the front wall, at the foot of which appear a number of other
flowers</i>.</p>

<p><i>A peach-tree carrying fruit stands near the foreground.
Beneath it sit the</i> <span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span> <i>and the</i> <span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>.</p>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">Judge</span> <i>wears a green cap with a peak, yellow
knee-breeches, and&mdash;a blue coat&mdash;all dating back to</i> 1820.
<i>The</i> Old Lady <i>wears a kerchief on her head and carries
a stick, spectacles, and snuff-box. She has the general
appearance of a "witch." At the right is a small expiatory
chapel containing an image of the Holy Virgin. The fence in
front of it is hung with wreaths and nosegays. A prie-dieu is
placed against the fence</i>.</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Life's eve has at last brought the sunshine which its morning
promised us. Early rains and late rains have blessed meadow and field.
And soon the songs of the vintagers will be heard all over the country.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Don't talk like that; somebody might hear you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Who could be listening here, and what harm could it do to thank
God for all good gifts?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. It's better not to mention one's good fortune lest misfortune
overhear it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. What of it? Was I not born with a caul?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Take care, take care! There are many who envy us, and evil
eyes are watching us.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Well, let them! That's the way it has always been. And yet I
have prospered.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. So far, yes. But I don't trust our neighbour. He has been
going around the village saying that we have cheated him out of his
property&mdash;and much more of the same kind which I don't care to repeat.
Of course, it doesn't matter when one has a clean conscience and can
point to a spotless life. Slander cannot hurt me. I go to confession
and mass, and I am prepared to close my eyes whenever my hour may
strike in order to open them again when I shall stand face to face with
my Judge. And I know also what I am going to answer then.</p>

<p>JUDGE. What are you going to answer?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Like this: I was not without fault, O Lord, but even if I was
but a poor, sinful human creature, I was nevertheless a little better
than my neighbour.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. I don't know what has brought you to these thoughts just now,
and I don't like them. Perhaps it is the fact that the mausoleum is to
be consecrated in a few days?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Perhaps that is it, for, as a rule, I don't give much thought
to death. I have still every tooth left in my mouth, and my hair is as
plentiful as when I was a bride.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Yes, yes&mdash;you have eternal youth, you as well as I, but just
the same we shall have to pass away. And as fortune has smiled on
us, we have wanted to avail ourselves of the privilege of resting in
ground belonging to ourselves And so we have built this little tomb
for ourselves here, where every tree knows us, where every flower will
whisper of our labours, and our troubles, and our struggles&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Yes, struggles against envious neighbours and ungrateful
children&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. There you said it: ungrateful children.&mdash;Have you seen anything
of Adolph?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. No, I haven't seen him since he started out this morning to
raise the money for the rent.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. The money which he will never get&mdash;and I still less. But he
knows now that the time of grace is up, for this is the third quarter
rent that he has failed to pay.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Yes, out with him into the world, and let him learn to work
instead of sitting here and playing at son-in-law. I'll keep Amelia and
the children&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Do you think Amelia will let herself be separated from Adolph?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. I think so, when it is a question whether her children are to
inherit anything from us or not&mdash;No, look! There it is again!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>On the wall of the mausoleum appears a spot of sunlight
like those which children are fond of producing with a small
mirror</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> <i>It is vibrating as if it were reflected by running
water</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. What is it? What is it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. On the mausoleum. Don't you see?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. It's the reflection of the sun on the river. It means&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. It means that we'll see the light of the sun for a long time
to come&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. On the contrary. But that's all one. The best pillow for one's
head is a good conscience, and the reward of the righteous never
fails.&mdash;There's our neighbour now.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. [<i>Enters</i>] Good evening, Judge. Good evening, madam.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Good evening, neighbour. How goes it? It wasn't yesterday we had
the pleasure. And how are your vines, I should have asked?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. The vines, yes&mdash;there's mildew on them, and the starlings
are after them, too.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Well, well! There's no mildew on my vines, and I have neither
seen nor heard of any starlings.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. Fate does not distribute its gifts evenly: one shall be
taken and the other left.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. I suppose there are good reasons for it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. I see! The reward of the righteous shall not fail, and the
wicked shall not have to wait for their punishment.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Oh, no malice meant! But you have to admit, anyhow, that it's
queer: two parcels of land lie side by side, and one yields good
harvests, the other poor ones&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. One yields starlings and the other not: that's what I find
queerer still. But, then, everybody wasn't born with a caul, like you,
Judge.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. What you say is true, and fortune <i>has</i> favoured me. I am
thankful for it, and there are moments when I feel proud of it as if I
had deserved it.&mdash;But listen, neighbour&mdash;you came as if you had been
sent for.&mdash;That leasehold of mine is vacant, and I wanted to ask you if
you care to take it.</p>


<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> In Sweden such spots are called "sun-cats."</p></div>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span> <i>has in the meantime left her seat and gone to
the mausoleum, where she is busying herself with the flowers</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. Oh, the leasehold is vacant. Hm! Since when?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Since this morning.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. Hm! So!&mdash;That means your son-in-law has got to go?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Yes, that good-for-nothing doesn't know how to manage.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. Tell me something else, Judge. Haven't you heard that the
state intends to build a military road across this property?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Oh, I have heard some rumours to that effect, but I don't think
it's anything but empty talk.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. On the contrary, I have read it in the papers. That would
mean condemnation proceedings, and the loser would be the holder of the
lease.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. I cannot think so, and I would never submit to it. I to leave
this spot where I expect to end my days in peace, and where I have
prepared a final resting-place to escape lying with all the rest&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. Wait a minute! One never knows what may prove one's final
resting-place. My father, who used to own this property, also expected
to be laid to rest in his own ground, but it happened otherwise. As far
as the leasehold is concerned, I must let it go.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. As you please. On my part the proposition was certainly
disinterested, as you are a man without luck. For it is no secret
that you fail in everything you undertake, and people have their own
thoughts about one who remains as solitary and friendless as you. Isn't
it a fact that you haven't a single friend?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. Yes, it's true. I have not a single friend, and that doesn't
look well. It is something I cannot deny.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. But to turn to other matters&mdash;is it true, as the legend has it,
that this vineyard once was a battle-field, and that this explains why
the wine from it is so fiery?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. No, that isn't what I have heard. My father told me that
this had been a place of execution, and that the gallows used to stand
where the mausoleum is now.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Oh, how dreadful! Why did you tell me?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. Because you asked, of course.&mdash;And the last man to be hanged
on this spot was an unrighteous judge. And now he lies buried here,
together with many others, among them being also an innocent victim of
his iniquity.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. What kind of stories are those! [<i>He calls out</i>] Caroline!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. And that's why his ghost has to come back here. Have you
never seen him, Judge?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. I have never seen anything at all!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. But I have seen him. As a rule, he appears at the time when
the grapes are harvested, and then they hear him around the wine-press
down in the cellar.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. [<i>Calling out</i>] Caroline!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. What is it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Come here!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. And he will never be at peace until he has suffered all the
torments his victim had to pass through.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Get away from here! Go!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. Certainly, Judge! I didn't know you were so sensitive. [<i>He
goes out</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. What was the matter?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Oh, he told a lot of stories that upset me. But-but&mdash;he is
plotting something evil, that fellow!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Didn't I tell you so! But you always let your tongue run
whenever you see anybody&mdash;What kind of foolish superstition was he
giving you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. I don't want to talk of it. The mere thought of it makes me
sick. I'll tell you some other time.&mdash;There's Adolph now!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ADOLPH</span>. [<i>Entering</i>] Good evening!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. [<i>After a pause</i>] Well?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ADOLPH</span>. Luck is against me. I have not been able to get any money.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. I suppose there are good reasons for it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ADOLPH</span>. I can see no reason why some people should fare well and others
badly.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Oh, you can't?&mdash;Well, look into your own heart; search your own
thoughts and actions, and you'll find that you have yourself to blame
for your misfortunes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ADOLPH</span>. Perhaps I may not call myself righteous in every respect, but
at least I have no serious crimes on my conscience.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. You had better think well&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ADOLPH</span>. I don't think that's needful, for my conscience is pretty
wakeful&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. It can be put to sleep&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ADOLPH</span>. Can it? Of course I have heard of evil-doers growing old in
crime, but as a rule their consciences wake up just before death; and
I have even heard of criminals whose consciences have awakened after
death.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. [<i>Agitated</i>] So that they had to come back, you mean? Have you
heard that story, too? It's strange that everybody seems to have heard
it except me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. What are you talking about? Stick to business instead.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ADOLPH</span>. Yes, I think that's wiser, too. And, as the subject has been
broached, I want to tell you what I propose&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Look here, my boy! I think it a good deal more appropriate that
I should tell you what I have decided. It is this: that from this day
you cease to be my tenant, and that before the sun sets you must start
out to look for work.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ADOLPH</span>. Are you in earnest?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. You ought to be ashamed! I am not in the habit of joking. And
you have no cause for complaint, as you have been granted respite twice.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ADOLPH</span>. While my crops have failed three times. Can I help that?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Nor have I said so. But I can help it still less. And you are
not being judged by me. Here is the contract&mdash;here's the broken
agreement. Was that agreement broken by me? Oh, no! So I am without
responsibility and wash my hands of the matter.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ADOLPH</span>. This may be the law, but I had thought there ought to be some
forbearance among relatives&mdash;especially as, in the natural course of
events, this property should pass on to your offspring.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Well, well: the natural course of events! He's going around
here wishing the life out of us! But you just look at me: I am good for
twenty years more. And I am <i>going</i> to live just to spite you!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. [<i>To</i> Adolph] What rudeness&mdash;what a lack of all human
feeling&mdash;to ask a couple of old people outright: are you not going to
die soon? You ought to be ashamed of yourself, I say! But now you have
broken the last tie, and all I can say is: go your way, and don't let
yourself be seen here any more!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ADOLPH</span>. That's plain talk! Well, I'll go, but not alone&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. So-o&mdash;you imagined that Amelia, our own child, should follow
you out on the highways, and that all you would have to do would be to
unload one child after another on us! But we have already thought of
that and put a stop to it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ADOLPH</span>. Where is Amelia? Where?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. You may just as well know. She has gone on; a visit to the
convent of the Poor Clares&mdash;only for a visit. So now you know it's of
no use to look for her here.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ADOLPH</span>. Some time you will have to suffer for your cruelty in depriving
a man in distress of his only support. And if you break up our
marriage, the penalty of that breach will fall on you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. You should be ashamed of putting your own guilt on those that
are innocent! Go now! And may you hunger and thirst, with every door
closed to you, until you have learned gratitude!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ADOLPH</span>. The same to you in double measure!&mdash;But let me only bid my
children good-bye, and I will go.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. As you don't want to spare your children the pain of
leave-taking, I'll do so&mdash;have already done it, in fact.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ADOLPH</span>. That, too! Then I believe you capable of all the evil that has
been rumoured. And now I know what our neighbour meant when he said
that you couldn't&mdash;endure the sun!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Not another word! Or you will feel the heavy hand of law and
justice&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>He raises his right hand so that the absence of its forefinger
becomes visible</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ADOLPH</span>. [<i>Takes hold of the hand and examines it</i>] The hand of
justice!&mdash;The hand of the perjurer whose finger stuck to the Bible when
he took his false oath! Woe unto you! Woe! For the day of retribution
is at hand, and your deeds will rise like corpses out of these
hillsides to accuse you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. What is that he is saying? It feels as if he were breathing
fire at us!&mdash;Go, you lying spirit, and may hell be your reward!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ADOLPH</span>. May Heaven reward you&mdash;according to your deserts&mdash;and may the
Lord protect my children! [<i>He goes out</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. What was that? Who was it that spoke? It seemed to me as if the
voice were coming out of some huge underground hall.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Did you hear it, too?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. God help us, then!&mdash;Do you remember what he said about the
sun? That struck me as more peculiar than all the rest. How could he
know&mdash;that it is so? Ever since my birth the sun has always burned
me, and they have told me this is so because my mother suffered from
sunstroke before I was born&mdash;but that you also&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. [<i>Frightened</i>] Hush! Talk of the devil, and&mdash;Isn't the sun
down?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Of course it is down!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. How can that spot of sunlight remain on the mausoleum, then?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[<i>The spot moves around</i>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Jesus Maria! That's an omen!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. An omen, you say! And on the grave! That doesn't happen every
day&mdash;and only a few chosen people who are full of living faith in the
highest things&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[<i>The spot of light disappears</i>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. There is something weird about the place to-night,
something ghastly.&mdash;But what hurt me most keenly was to hear that
good-for-nothing wishing the life out of us in order to get at the
property. Do you know what I&mdash;well, I wonder if I dare to speak of
it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Go on!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Have you heard the story that this spot here used to be a place
of execution?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. So you have found that out, too?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Yes&mdash;and you knew it?&mdash;Well, suppose we gave this property
to the convent? That would make the ground sacred, and it would be
possible to rest in peace in it. The income might go to the children
while they are growing up, and it would mean an additional gain, as
Adolph would be fooled in his hope of inheriting from us. I think this
a remarkably happy solution of a difficult problem: how to give away
without losing anything by it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Your superior intelligence has again asserted itself, and I
am quite of your opinion. But suppose condemnation proceedings should
be started&mdash;what would happen then?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. There is plenty of time to consider that when it happens. In
the meantime, let us first of all, and as quietly as possible, get the
mausoleum consecrated&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FRANCISCAN</span>. [<i>Enters</i>] The peace of the Lord be with you, Judge, and
with you, madam!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. You come most conveniently, Father, to hear something that
concerns the convent&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FRANCISCAN</span>. I am glad of it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The spot of light appears again on the mausoleum</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. And then we wanted to ask when the consecration of the
mausoleum might take place.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FRANCISCAN</span>. [<i>Staring at her</i>] Oh, is that so?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Look, Father&mdash;look at that omen&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Yes, the spot must be sacred, indeed&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FRANCISCAN</span>. That's a will-o'-the-wisp.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Is it not a good sign? Does it not carry some kind of
message? Does it not prompt a pious mind to stop and consider? Would it
not be possible to turn this place into a refuge for desert wanderers
who are seeking&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FRANCISCAN</span>. Madam, let me speak a word to you in private. [<i>He moves
over to the right.</i></p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. [<i>Following him</i>] Father?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FRANCISCAN</span>. [<i>Speaking in a subdued voice</i>] You, madam, enjoy a
reputation in this vicinity which you don't deserve, for you are the
worst sinner that I know of. You want to buy your pardon, and you want
to steal heaven itself, you who have already stolen from the Lord.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. What is it I hear?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FRANCISCAN</span>. When you were sick and near death you made a vow to the
Lord that in case of recovery you would give a monstrance of pure gold
to the convent church. Your health was restored and you gave the holy
vessel, but it was of silver&mdash;gilded. Not for the sake of the gold, but
because of your broken vow and your deception, you are already damned.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. I didn't know it. The goldsmith has cheated me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FRANCISCAN</span>. You are lying, for I have the goldsmith's bill.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Is there no pardon for it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FRANCISCAN</span>. No! For it is a mortal sin to cheat God.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Woe is me!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FRANCISCAN</span>. The settlement of your other crimes will have to take place
within yourself. But if you as much as touch a hair on the heads of the
children, then you shall learn who is their protector, and you shall
feel the iron rod.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. The idea&mdash;that this infernal monk should dare to say such
things to me! If I am damned&mdash;then I want to be damned! Ha, ha!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FRANCISCAN</span>. Well, you may be sure that there will be no blessing for
your house and no peace for yourself until you have suffered every
suffering that you have brought on others.&mdash;May I speak a word with
you, Judge?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> Judge <i>approaches</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Yes, give him what he deserves, so that one may be as good as
the other.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FRANCISCAN</span>. [<i>To the</i> Judge] Where did you get the idea of building
your tomb where the gallows used to stand?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. I suppose I got it from the devil!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FRANCISCAN</span>. Like the idea of casting off your children and robbing them
of their inheritance? But you have also been an unrighteous judge&mdash;you
have violated oaths and accepted bribes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. I?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FRANCISCAN</span>. And now you want to erect a monument to yourself! You
want to build yourself an imperishable house in heaven! But listen to
me: this spot will never be consecrated, and you may consider it a
blessing if you are permitted to rest in common ground among ordinary
little sinners. There is a curse laid on this soil, because blood-guilt
attaches to it and because it is ill-gotten.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. What am I to do?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FRANCISCAN</span>. Repent, and restore the stolen property.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. I have never stolen. Everything has been legally acquired.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FRANCISCAN</span>. That, you see, is the worst part of all&mdash;that you regard
your crimes as lawful. Yes, I know that you even consider yourself
particularly favoured by Heaven because of your righteousness. But now
you will soon see what harvest is in store for you. Thorns and thistles
will grow in your vineyard. Helpless and abandoned you shall be, and
the peace of your old age will turn into struggle and strife.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. The devil you say!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FRANCISCAN</span>. Don't call him&mdash;he'll come anyhow!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Let him come! Because we believe, we have no fear!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FRANCISCAN</span>. The devils believe also, and tremble!&mdash;Farewell! [<i>He goes
out</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. [<i>To his wife</i>] What did he say to you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. You think I'll tell? What did he have to say to you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. And you think I'll tell?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Are you going to keep any secrets from me?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. And how about you? It's what you have always done, but I'll get
to the bottom of your tricks some time.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Just wait a little, and I'll figure out where you keep the
money that is missing.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. So you are hiding money, too! Now there is no longer any use
in playing the hypocrite&mdash;just let yourself be seen in all your
abomination, you witch!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. I think you have lost your reason&mdash;not that it was much to
keep! But you might at least preserve an appearance of decency, if you
can&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. And you might preserve your beauty&mdash;if you can! And your
perennial youth&mdash;ha, ha, ha! And your righteousness! You must have
known how to bewitch people, and hoodwink them, for now I see how
horribly ugly and old you are.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. [<i>On whom the spot of light now appears</i>] Woe! It is burning
me!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. There I see you as you really are! [<i>The spot jumps to the</i>
<span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>] Woe! It is burning me now!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. And how you look! [<i>Both withdraw to the right</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. Yes, child, there is justice, both human and divine, but we
must have patience.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AMELIA</span>. I am willing to believe that justice is done, in spite of all
appearances to the contrary. But I cannot love my mother, and I have
never been able to do so. There is something within me that keeps
telling me that she is not only indifferent to me but actually hostile.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. So you have found it out?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AMELIA</span>. Why&mdash;she hates me, and a mother couldn't do that!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. Well, well!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AMELIA</span>. And I suffer from not being able to do my duty as a child and
love her.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. Well, as <i>that</i> has made you suffer, then you will soon&mdash;in
the hour of retribution&mdash;learn the great secret of your life.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AMELIA</span>. And I could stand everything, if she were only kind to my
children.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. Don't fear on that account, for her power is now ended. The
measure of her wickedness has been heaped full and is now overflowing.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AMELIA</span>. Do you think so? But this very day she tore my Adolph away from
me, and now she has humiliated me still further by dressing me as a
servant girl and making me do the work in the kitchen.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. Patience!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AMELIA</span>. Yes, so you say! Oh, I can understand deserved suffering, but
to suffer without cause&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. My dear child, the prisoners in the penitentiary are
suffering justly, so there is no honour in that; but to be permitted to
suffer unjustly, that's a grace and a trial of which steadfast souls
bring home golden fruits.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AMELIA</span>. You speak so beautifully that everything you say seems true
to me.&mdash;Hush! There are the children&mdash;and I don't want them to see me
dressed like this.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THYRA</span>. Oh, you beautiful sun! But didn't he go to bed a while ago?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Perhaps he is allowed to stay up longer than usual because he has
been very good all day.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THYRA</span>. But how could the sun be good? Now you are stupid, Eric.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Of course the sun can be good&mdash;doesn't he make the grapes and the
peaches?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THYRA</span>. But if he is so good, then he might also give us a peach.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. So he will, if we only wait a little. Aren't there any on the
ground at all?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THYRA</span>. [<i>Looking</i>] No, but perhaps we might get one from the tree.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. No, grandmother won't let us.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THYRA</span>. Grandmother has said that we mustn't shake the tree, but I
thought we could play around the tree so that one might fall down
anyhow&mdash;of itself.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Now you are stupid, Thyra. That would be exactly the same thing.
[<i>Looking up at the tree</i>] Oh, if only a peach would fall down!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THYRA</span>. None will fall unless you shake.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. You mustn't talk like that, Thyra, for that is a sin.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THYRA</span>. Let's pray God to let one fall.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. One shouldn't pray God for anything nice&mdash;that is, to eat!&mdash;Oh,
little peach, won't you fall? I want you to fall! [<i>A peach falls from
the tree, and</i> <span class="small-c">ERIC</span> <i>picks it up</i>] There, what a nice tree!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THYRA</span>. But now you must give me half, for it was I who said that the
tree had to be shaken&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. [<i>Enters with a big birch rod</i>] So you have been shaking the
tree&mdash;now you'll see what you'll get, you nasty children&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. No, grandmother, we didn't shake the tree!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. So you are lying, too. Didn't I hear Thyra say that the tree
had to be shaken? Come along now, and I'll lock you up in the cellar

madam.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Two witnesses behind the bushes&mdash;exactly as if we were in
court. But I know the tricks, I tell you, and what I have heard and
seen is sufficient evidence for me.&mdash;Come along, you brats!</p>

doctor?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Or Father Colomba, perhaps?</p>

seems to wear no linen. A red woollen muffler is wound around
his neck. He wears spectacles and carries a piece of rattan
under his arm</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OTHER ONE</span>. The sign of the cross does not frighten me, for I am
undergoing my ordeal merely that I may wear it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Who are you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OTHER ONE</span>. I became the Other One because I wanted to be the First
One. I was a man of evil, and my punishment is to serve the good.</p>

cross, before which we are to meet some time.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. [<i>Enters</i>] Well, child, how is your patience?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AMELIA</span>. Thank you, neighbour, it might be worse. But I never had a
worse job than this silver service here. I have worked at it for half
an hour and cannot get it clean.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. That's strange, but I suppose there are reasons for it, as
the Judge says. Could you sleep last night?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AMELIA</span>. Thank you, I slept very well. But do you know that father spent
the whole night in the vineyard with his rattle&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. Yes, I heard him. What kind of foolish idea was that?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AMELIA</span>. He thought he heard the starlings that had come to eat the
grapes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. Poor fellow! As if the starlings were abroad nights!&mdash;And
the children?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AMELIA</span>. Well, the children&mdash;she is still keeping them in the cellar,
and I hope she won't forget to give them something to eat.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. He who feeds the birds will not forget your children,
my dear Amelia. And now I'll tell you something which, as a rule,
shouldn't be told. There is a small hole in the wall between the
Judge's wine-cellar and my own. When I was down there this morning to
get the place aired out, I heard voices. And when I looked through the
hole, I saw Eric and Thyra playing with a strange little boy.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AMELIA</span>. You could see them, neighbour? And&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. They were happy and well&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AMELIA</span>. Who was their playmate?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. That's more than I can guess.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AMELIA</span>. This whole dreadful house is nothing but secrets.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. That is true, but it is not for us to inquire into them.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. [<i>Enters, carrying a rattle</i>] So you are in here conspiring,
neighbour! Is it not enough that your evil eye has brought the
starlings into my vineyard? For you do have the evil eye&mdash;but we'll
soon put it out. I know a trick or two myself.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">AMELIA</span>] Is it worth while to set him right? One who
doesn't believe what is told him! [<i>He goes out</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AMELIA</span>. No, this is beyond us!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Tell me, Amelia, have you noticed where your mother is looking
for things when she believes herself to be alone?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AMELIA</span>. No, father.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. I can see by your eyes that you know. You were looking this
way. [<i>He goes up to a chest of drawers and happens to get into the
sunlight</i>] Damn the sun that is always burning me! [<i>He pulls down one
of the shades and returns to the chest of drawers</i>] This must be the
place!&mdash;Now, let me see! The stupidest spot is also the cleverest, so
that's where I must look&mdash;as in this box of perfume, for instance&mdash;And
right I was! [<i>He pulls out a number of bank-notes and stocks</i>] What's
this? Twelve English bills of a pound each. Twelve of them!&mdash;Oho! Then
it is easy to imagine the rest. [<i>Pushes the bills and securities into
his pockets</i>] But what is it I hear? There are the starlings again!
[<i>He goes to an open window and begins to play the rattle</i>] Get away
there!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. [<i>Enters</i>] Are you still playing the ghost?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Are you not in the kitchen?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. No, as you see, I am not. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">AMELIA</span>] Are you not done with
the cleaning yet?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AMELIA</span>. No, mother, I'll never get done with it. The silver won't
clean, and I don't think it is real.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Not real? Let me see!&mdash;Why, indeed, it's quite black! [<i>To
the</i> <span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>, <i>who in the meantime has pulled down another shade</i>] Where
did you get this set from?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. That one? Why, it came from an estate.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. For your services as executor! What you got was like what you
gave!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. You had better not make any defamatory remarks, for they are
punishable under the law.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Are you crazy, or was there anything crazy about my remark?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. And for that matter, it is silver&mdash;sterling silver.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Then it must be Amelia's fault.</p>

<p>A <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">VOICE</span>. [<i>Coming through the window from the outside</i>] The Judge can
turn white into black, but he can't turn black into white!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Who said that?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. It seemed as if one of the starlings had been speaking.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. [<i>Pulling down the remaining shade</i>] Now the sun is here, and a
while ago it seemed to be over there.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">AMELIA</span>] Who was it that spoke?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AMELIA</span>. I think it was that strange school-teacher with the red muffler.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Ugh! Let us talk of something else.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SERVANT GIRL</span>. [<i>Enters</i>] Dinner is served.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>She goes out; a pause follows</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. You go down and eat, Amelia.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AMELIA</span>. Thank you, mother. [<i>She goes out</i>.</p>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">JUDGE</span> <i>sits down on a chair close to one of the chests</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. [<i>Sliding up to the chest of drawers &gt;where the box of
perfume stands</i>] Are you not going to eat anything?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. No, I am not hungry. How about you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. I have just eaten. [<i>Pause</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. [<i>Takes a piece of bread from his pocket</i>] Then you'll excuse
me, I'm sure.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. There's a roast of venison on the table.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. You don't say so!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Do you think I poison the food?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Yes, it tasted of carbolic acid this morning.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. And what I ate had a sort of metallic taste&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. If I assure you that I have put nothing whatever in your food&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Then I don't believe you. But I can assure you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. And I won't believe it. [<i>Eating his bread</i>] Roast of venison
is a good thing&mdash;I can smell it from here&mdash;but bread isn't bad either.
[<i>Pause</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Why are you sitting there watching that chest?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. For the same reason that makes you guard those perfumes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. So you have been there, you sneak-thief!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Ghoul!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. To think of it&mdash;such words between us! <i>Us</i>!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>She begins to weep</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Yes, the world is evil and so is man.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Yes, you may well say so&mdash;and ungrateful above all.
Ungrateful children rob you of the rent; ungrateful grandchildren rob
the fruit from the trees. You are right, indeed: the world is evil&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. I ought to know, I who have had to witness all the rottenness,
and who have been forced to pass the death sentence. That is why the
mob hates me, just as if I had made the laws&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. It doesn't matter what the people say, if you have only a
clean conscience&mdash;[<i>Three loud knocks are heard from the inside of the
biggest wardrobe</i>] What was that? Who is there?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Oh, it was that wardrobe. It always cracks when there is rain
coming. [<i>Three distinct knocks are heard again</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. It's some kind of performance started by that strolling
charlatan.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The cover of the coffee-pot which</i> <span class="small-c">AMELIA</span> <i>was cleaning, opens
and drops down again with a bang; this happens several times in
succession</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. What was <i>that</i>, then?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Oh, yes, it's that same juggler. He can play tricks, but he
can't scare me. [<i>The coffee-pot acts as before.</i></p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Do you think he is one of those mesmerists?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Well, whatever it happens to be called&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. If that's so, how can he know our private secrets?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Secrets? What do you mean by that?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>A clock begins to strike and keeps it up as if it never meant
to stop</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Now I am getting scared.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Then Old Nick himself may take me if I stay here another
minute! [<i>The spot of sunlight appears suddenly on the portrait of the</i>
<span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>] Look! He knows that secret, too!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. You mean that there is a portrait of <i>her</i> behind yours?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Come away from here and let us go down and eat. And let us
see whether we can't sell off the house and all the rest at auction&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. You are right&mdash;sell off the whole caboodle and start a new
life!&mdash;And now let us go down and eat.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">THE OTHER ONE</span>] Who are you, sir?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OTHER ONE</span>. I have told you twice. That you don't believe me is a
part of your punishment, for if you could believe, your sufferings
would be shortened by it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. [<i>To his wife</i>] It's&mdash;<i>him</i>&mdash;sure enough! For I feel as if I

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. [<i>To the</i> <span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>] Is he gone?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OTHER ONE</span>. I thank you for the music, madam. It lulls the pain
and awakens memories of better things even in a lost soul&mdash;Thank you,
madam!&mdash;Speaking of the auction, I think you are doing right, although,
in my opinion, an honest declaration of bankruptcy would be still
better&mdash;Yes, surrender your goods, and let every one get back his own.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Bankruptcy? I have no debts&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OTHER ONE</span>. No debts!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. My husband <i>has</i> no debts!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OTHER ONE</span>. No debts! That would be happiness, indeed!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Well, that's the truth! But other people are in debt to me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OTHER ONE</span>. Forgive them then!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. This is not a question of pardon, but of payment&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OTHER ONE</span>. All right! Then you'll be made to pay!&mdash;For the
moment&mdash;farewell! But we'll meet frequently, and the last time at the
great auction! [<i>He goes out backward</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. He's afraid of the sun&mdash;he, too! Ha-ha!</p>

myself to the light, I shall hate darkness.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Of course, that's not the way he is supposed to look but then
times are changing and we with them. They used to say that he had gold
and fame to give away, but this fellow goes around dunning&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Oh, he's a sorry lot, and a charlatan&mdash;that's all! A milksop
who doesn't dare to bite, no matter how much he would like to!</p>

pray! Get up now, or&mdash;Yes, now you believe, although I don't wear
a red cloak, and don't carry sword or purse, and don't crack any
jokes&mdash;but beware of taking me in jest! I am serious as sin and stern

<p><span class="small-c">PLAYMATE</span>. [<i>Smiling</i>] Shall I tell a story?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THYRA</span>. Yes, but not out of the Bible, for all those we know by heart&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">PLAYMATE</span> <i>smiles again</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. You say such things, Thyra, that he gets hurt&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">PLAYMATE</span>. No, my little friends, you don't hurt me&mdash;But now, if you are
really good, we'll go and play in the open&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Oh, yes, yes!&mdash;But then, you know, grandmother won't let us&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">PLAYMATE</span>. Yes, your grandmother has said that she wished you were out,
and so we'll go before she changes her mind. Come on now!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THYRA</span>. Oh, what fun! Oh&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The door in the rear flies open and through the doorway is
seen a sunlit field planted with rye ready for the harvest.
Among the yellow ears grow bachelor's-buttons and daisies</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">PLAYMATE</span>. Come, children! Come into the sunlight and feel the joy of
living!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THYRA</span>. Can't we take the sun-spot along? It's a pity to leave it here
in the darkness.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">PLAYMATE</span>. Yes, if it is willing to go with you. Call it!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span> <i>and</i> <span class="small-c">THYRA</span> <i>go toward the door, followed by the spot of light</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Isn't it a nice little spot! [<i>Talks to the spot as if it were a
cat</i>] Puss, puss, puss, puss!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">PLAYMATE</span>. Take it up on your arm, Thyra, for I don't think it can get
over the threshold.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THYRA</span> <i>gets the spot of light on her arm, which she bends as if
carrying something</i>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>All three go out; the door closes itself. Pause</i>.</p>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">JUDGE</span> <i>enters with a lantern, the</i> <span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span> <i>with the
birch rod</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. It's cool and nice here, and then there is no sun to bother
you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. And how quiet it is. But where are the children?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Both look for the children</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. It looks as if they had taken us at our word.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Us? Please observe that I didn't promise anything, for
he&mdash;you know&mdash;talked only to you toward the end.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Perhaps, but this time we had better obey, for I don't want to
have any more trouble with hail-storms and such things.&mdash;However, the
children are not here, and I suppose they'll come back when they get
hungry.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. And I wish them luck when they do! [<i>The rod is snatched out
of her hand and dances across the floor; finally it disappears behind
one of the casks</i>] Now it's beginning again.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Well, why don't you submit and do as he&mdash;you know who!&mdash;says? I,
for my part, don't dare to do wrong any longer. The growing grapes have
been destroyed, and we must take pleasure in what is already safe. Come
here, Caroline, and let us have a glass of something good to brace us
up! [<i>He knocks on one of the casks and draws a glass of wine from it</i>]
This is from the year of the comet&mdash;anno 1869, when the big comet came,
and everybody said it meant war. And, of course, war did break out.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>He offers a filled glass to his wife</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. You drink first!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Well, now&mdash;did you think there might be poison in this, too?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. No, really, I didn't&mdash;but&mdash;we'll never again know what peace
is, or happiness!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Do as I do: submit! [<i>He drinks</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. I want to, and I try to, but when I come to think how badly
other people have treated us, I feel that I am just as good as anybody
else. [<i>She drinks</i>] That's a very fine wine! [<i>She sits down</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. The wine is good, and it makes the mind easier.&mdash;Yes, the
wiseacres say that we are rapscallions, one and all, so I can't see
what right anybody has to go around finding fault with the rest. [<i>He
drinks</i>] My own actions have always been legal; that is, in keeping
with prevailing laws and constitutions. If others happened to be
ignorant of the law, they had only themselves to blame, for no one has
a right to ignorance of that kind. For that reason, if Adolph does not
pay the rent, it is he who breaks the law, and not I.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. And yet the blame falls on you, and you are made to appear
like a criminal. Yes, it is as I have always said: there is no justice
in this world. If you had done right, you should have brought suit
against Adolph and turned out the whole family. But then it isn't too
late yet&mdash;&mdash; [<i>She drinks</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Well, you see, if I were to carry out the law strictly, then I
should sue for the annulment of his marriage, and that would cut him
off from the property&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Why don't you do it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. [<i>Looking around</i>] We-e-ell!&mdash;I suppose that would settle the
matter once for all. A divorce would probably not be granted, but I
think it would be possible to get the marriage declared invalid on
technical grounds&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. And if there be no such grounds?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. [<i>Showing the influence of the wine</i>] There are technical
grounds for everything, if you only look hard enough.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Well, then! Think of it&mdash;how that good-for-nothing is wishing
the life out of us&mdash;but now he'll see how "the natural course of
events" makes the drones take to the road&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Ha-ha! You're right, quite right! And then, you know, when I
think it over carefully&mdash;what reason have we for self-reproach? What
wrong have we done? It's mean to bring up that about the monstrance&mdash;it
didn't hurt anybody, did it? And as for my being guilty of perjury:
that's a pure lie. I got blood-poison in the finger&mdash;that's all&mdash;and
quite a natural thing.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Just as if I didn't know it. And I may as well add that this
hail-storm a while ago&mdash;why, it was as plain a thing as if it had been
foretold in the Farmer's Almanac!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Exactly! That's what I think too. And for that reason, Caroline,
I think we had better forget all that fool talk&mdash;and if you feel as I
do, we'll just turn to another priest and get him to consecrate the
mausoleum.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Well, why shouldn't we?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Yes, why shouldn't we? Perhaps because that mesmerist comes here
and talks a lot of superstitious nonsense?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Tell me, do you really think he is nothing but a mesmerist?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. [<i>Blustering</i>] That fellow? He's a first-class charlatan. A
che-ar-la-tan!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. [<i>Looking around</i>] I am not so sure.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. But I am sure. Su-ure! And if he should ever come before my eyes
again&mdash;just now, for instance&mdash;I'll drink his health and say: here's
to you, old humourist! [As <i>he raises the glass, it is torn out of his
hand and is seen to disappear through the wall</i>] What was that? [<i>The
lantern goes out.</i> <span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Help!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>A gust of wind is heard, and then all is silence again</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. You just get some matches, and I'll clear this matter up. For I
am no longer afraid of anything. Not of anything!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Oh, don't, don't!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OTHER ONE</span>. [<i>Steps from behind one of the casks</i>] Now we'll have to
have a talk in private.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. [<i>Frightened</i>] Where did you come from?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OTHER ONE</span>. That is no concern of yours.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. [<i>Straightening himself up</i>] What kind of language is that?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OTHER ONE</span>. Your own!&mdash;Off with your cap! [<i>He blows at the</i> <span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>,
<i>whose cap is lifted off his head and falls to the ground</i>] Now you
shall hear sentence pronounced: you have wanted to sever what has been
united by Him whose name I may not mention. Therefore you shall be
separated from her who ought to be the staff of your old age. Alone
you must run the gauntlet. Alone you must bear the qualms of sleepless
nights.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Is that mercy?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OTHER ONE</span>. It is justice; it is the law: an eye for an eye, and a
tooth for a tooth! The gospel has a different sound, but of that you
didn't want to hear. Now, move I along. [<i>He beats the air with the
rattan.</i></p>

<p><i>Back of the garden appears a field of rye, all yellow and

beech woods and ruined castles on them</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THYRA</span>. Who is living here?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">PLAYMATE</span>. Whoever feels at home has his home here.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THYRA</span>. Can we play here?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">PLAYMATE</span>. Anywhere except in that avenue over there to the right.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. And may we pick the flowers?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">PLAYMATE</span>. You may pick any flowers you want, but you mustn't touch the
tree at the fountain.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THYRA</span>. What kind of tree is that?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Why, you know, it is one of those they call [<i>lowering his
voice</i>] "Christ's Blood-drops."</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THYRA</span>. You should cross yourself, Eric, when you mention the name of
the Lord.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. [<i>Makes the sign of the cross</i>] Tell me, little boy, why mustn't
we touch the tree?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THYRA</span>. You should obey without asking any questions, Eric.&mdash;But tell
me, little boy, why is that ugly scarecrow hanging there? Can't we take
it away?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">PLAYMATE</span>. Yes, indeed, you may, for then the birds will come and sing
for us.</p>

birds! [<i>The Golden Bird comes flying from the right and perches on the

<p><span class="small-c">THYRA</span>. Oh, how pretty it is! Does it sing, too?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Can you understand what the bird sings, boy?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">PLAYMATE</span>. No, children, the birds have little secrets of their own
which they have a right to keep hidden.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THYRA</span>. Of course, Eric, don't you see, otherwise the children could
tell where the nests are, and then they would take away the eggs, and
that would make the birds sorry, and they couldn't have any children of
their own.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. Don't talk like a grown-up, Thyra.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">PLAYMATE</span>. [<i>Putting a finger across his lips</i>] Hush! Somebody is

<p><span class="small-c">CHIMNEY-SWEEP</span>. [<i>Takes off his cap; speaks bashfully</i>] Oh, you don't
want to play with me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">PLAYMATE</span>. Why shouldn't we?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CHIMNEY-SWEEP</span>. I am sooty all over. And besides I don't know how to
play&mdash;I hardly know what it is.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THYRA</span>. Think of it, the poor boy has never played.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">PLAYMATE</span>. What is your name?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CHIMNEY-SWEEP</span>. My name? They call me Ole&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">PLAYMATE</span>. But what's your other name?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CHIMNEY-SWEEP</span>. Other name? I have none.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">PLAYMATE</span>. But your papa's name?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CHIMNEY-SWEEP</span>. I have no papa.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">PLAYMATE</span>. And your mamma's?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CHIMNEY-SWEEP</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">PLAYMATE</span>. He has no papa or mamma. Come to the spring here, boy, and
I'll make you as white as a little prince.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CHIMNEY-SWEEP</span>. If anybody else said it, I shouldn't believe it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">PLAYMATE</span>. Why do you believe it then, when I say it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CHIMNEY-SWEEP</span>. I don't know, but I think you look as if it would be
true.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">PLAYMATE</span>. Give the boy your hand, Thyra!&mdash;Would you give him a kiss,
too?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THYRA</span>. [<i>After a moment's hesitation</i>] Yes, when you ask me!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">PLAYMATE</span>. No, he has never been bad. But he had a bad guardian who took

What is it I see? Eric and Thyra with a strange boy! What can it mean?
For they are not here. It must be an oracle spring. [<i>She takes a cup

Everything is poisoned! Everything!&mdash;And I feel tired, too, although

<p><span class="small-c">THE OTHER ONE</span>. I am looking like this because once I touched the tree.
Afterward it was my joy to tempt others into doing the same. But now,
since I have grown old, I have come to repent, and now I am remaining
here to warn men, but nobody believes me&mdash;nobody&mdash;because I lied once.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC</span>. You don't need to warn us, and you can't tempt us.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Well, at last, there you are.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WITCH</span>. You have kept me waiting. Why have you called me?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Help me!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WITCH</span>. In what way?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Against my enemies.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WITCH</span>. There is only one thing that helps against your enemies: be good
to them.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Well, I declare! I think the whole world has turned
topsyturvy.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WITCH</span>. Yes, so it may seem.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Even the Other One&mdash;you know who I mean&mdash;has become
converted.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WITCH</span>. Then it ought to be time for you, too.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Time for me? You mean that my years are burdening me? But it
is less than three weeks since I danced at a wedding.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WITCH</span>. And you call that bliss! Well, if that be all, you shall have
your fill of it. For there is to be a ball here to-night, although I
myself cannot attend it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Here?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WITCH</span>. Just here. It will begin whenever I give the word&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. It's too bad I haven't got on my low-necked dress.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WITCH</span>. You can borrow one from me&mdash;and a pair of dancing shoes with red
heels.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Perhaps I might also have a pair of gloves and a fan?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WITCH</span>. Everything! And, in particular, any number of young cavaliers
who will proclaim you the queen of the ball.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Now you are joking.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WITCH</span>. No, I am not joking. And I know that they have the good taste at
these balls to choose the right one for queen&mdash;and in speaking of the
right one, I have in mind the most worthy&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. The most beautiful, you mean?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WITCH</span>. No, I don't&mdash;I mean the worthiest. If you wish, I'll start the
ball at once.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. I have no objection.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WITCH</span>. If you step aside a little, you'll find your maid&mdash;while the
hall is being put in order.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. [<i>Going out to the right</i>] Think of it&mdash;I am going to have a
maid, too! You know, madam, that was the dream of my youth&mdash;which never
came true.</p>

<p><i>Without curtain-fall, the stage changes to represent the
bottom of a rocky, kettle-shaped chasm. It is closed in on
three sides by steep walls of black rock, wholly stripped of
vegetation. At the left, in the foreground, stands a throne. At
the right is a platform for the musicians</i>.</p>

<p><i>A bust of Pan on a square base stands in the middle of the
stage, surrounded by a strange selection of potted plants:
henbane, burdock, thistle, onion, etc.</i></p>

<p><i>The musicians enter. Their clothing is grey; their faces are
chalk-white and sad; their gestures tired. They appear to be
tuning their instruments, but not a sound is heard</i>.</p>

<p><i>Then comes the</i> <span class="small-c">LEADER OF THE ORCHESTRA</span>.</p>

<p><i>After him, the guests of the ball: cripples, beggars, tramps.

<p><i>Next: The</i> <span class="small-c">MASTER OF CEREMONIES</span>, <i>who is really</i> <span class="small-c">THE OTHER
ONE</span><i>&mdash;a septuagenarian dandy wearing a black wig which is too
small for him, so that tufts of grey hair appear underneath.
His mustaches are waxed and pointed. He wears a monocle and has
on an outgrown evening dress and top-boots. He looks melancholy
and seems to be suffering because of the part he has to play.</i></p>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">SEVEN DEADLY SINS</span> <i>enter and group themselves around the

<p><i>The ensuing scene must be played with deadly seriousness,
without a trace of irony, satire, or humour. There is a
suggestion of a death-mask in the face of every figure. They
move noiselessly and make simple, awkward gestures that convey
the impression of a drill</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">PRINCE</span>. [<i>To the</i> <span class="small-c">MASTER OF CEREMONIES</span>] Why do you disturb my peace at
this midnight hour?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF CEREMONIES</span>. Always, brother, you are asking why. Have you not
seen the light yet?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Only in part. I can perceive a connection between my suffering
and my guilt, but I cannot see why I should have to suffer eternally,
when He has suffered in my place.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF CEREMONIES</span>. Eternally? You died only yesterday. But then time
ceased to exist to you, and so a few hours appear like an eternity.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Yesterday?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF CEREMONIES</span>. Yes.&mdash;But because you were proud and wanted no
assistance, you have now to bear your own sufferings.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. What have I done, then?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF CEREMONIES</span>. What a sublime question!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. But why don't you tell?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF CEREMONIES</span>. As our task is to torture each other by
truth-telling&mdash;were we not called "heroes of truth" in our lifetime?&mdash;I
shall tell you a part of your own secret. You were, and you are still,
a hunchback&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. What is that?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF CEREMONIES</span>. There you see! You don't know what is known to
everybody else. But all those others pitied you, and so you never heard
the word that names your own deformity.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. What deformity is that? Perhaps you mean that I have a weak
chest? But that is no deformity.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF CEREMONIES</span>. A "weak chest"&mdash;yes, that is your own name for
the matter. However, people kept the disfigurement of your body hidden
from you, and they tried to assuage your misfortune by showing you
sympathy and kindness. But you accepted their generosity as an earned
tribute, their encouraging words as expressions of admiration due to
your superior physique. And at last you went so far in conceit that
you regarded yourself as a type of masculine beauty. And when, to cap
it all, woman granted you her favours out of pity, then you believed
yourself an irresistible conqueror.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. What right have you to say such rude things to me?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF CEREMONIES</span>. Right? I am filling the saddening duty which
forces one sinner to punish another. And soon you will have to fulfil
the same cruel duty toward a woman who is vain to the verge of
madness&mdash;a woman resembling you as closely as she possibly could.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. I don't want to do it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF CEREMONIES</span>. Try to do anything but what you must, and you'll
experience an inner discord that you cannot explain.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. What does it mean?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF CEREMONIES</span>. It means that you cannot all of a sudden cease to
be what you are: and you are what you have wanted to become. [<i>He claps
his hands</i>.</p>

dress, red shoes, and a fan made out of peacock feathers</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. [<i>A little uncertain</i>] Where am I? Is this the right place?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF CEREMONIES</span>. Quite right, for you are in the place we call
the "waiting-room." It is so called [<i>he sighs],</i> because here we have
to spend our time waiting&mdash;waiting for something that will come some
time&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Well, it isn't bad at all&mdash;and there is the music&mdash;and there
is a bust&mdash;of whom?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF CEREMONIES</span>. It's a pagan idol called Pan, because to the
ancients he was all they had. And as we, in this place, are of the old
order, more or less antiquated, he has been put here for us to look at.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Why, we are not old&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF CEREMONIES</span>. Yes, my Queen. When the new era opened [<i>he
sighs</i>], we couldn't keep up with it, and so we were left behind&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. The new era? What kind of talk is that? When did it begin?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF CEREMONIES</span>. It is easy to figure out when the year one
began&mdash;It was night, for that matter; the stars were shining brightly,
and the weather must have been mild, as the shepherds remained in the
open&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Oh, yes, yes&mdash;Are we not going to dance here to-night?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF CEREMONIES</span>. Of course, we are. The Prince is waiting for a
chance to ask you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. [<i>To the</i> <span class="small-c">MASTER OF CEREMONIES</span>] IS he a real Prince?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF CEREMONIES</span>. A real one, my Queen. That is to say, he has full
reality in a certain fashion&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. [<i>To the</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>, <i>who is asking her to dance</i>] You don't
look happy, my Prince?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. I am not happy.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Well, I can't say that I find it very hilarious&mdash;and the
place smells of putty, as if the glazier had just been at work here.
What is that strange smell, as of linseed-oil?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. [<i>With an expression of horror</i>] What are you saying? Do you
mean that charnel-house smell?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. I fear I must have said something impolite&mdash;but then, it
isn't for the ladies to offer pleasantries&mdash;that's what the cavalier
should do&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. What can I tell you that you don't know before?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. That I don't know before? Let me see&mdash;No, then I had better
tell you that you are very handsome, my Prince.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Now you exaggerate, my Queen. I am not exactly handsome, but I
have always been held what they call "good-looking."</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Just like me&mdash;I never was a beauty&mdash;that is, I <i>am</i> not,
considering my years&mdash;Oh, I am so stupid!&mdash;What was it I wanted to say?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF CEREMONIES</span>. Let the music begin!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>The musicians appear to be playing, but not a sound is heard</i>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF CEREMONIES</span>. Well? Are you not going to dance?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. [<i>Sadly</i>] No, I don't care to dance.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF CEREMONIES</span>. But you must: you are the only presentable
gentleman.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. That's true, I suppose&mdash;[<i>pensively</i>] but is that a fit
occupation for me?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF CEREMONIES</span>. How do you mean?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. At times it seems as if I had something else to think of, but
then&mdash;then I forget it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF CEREMONIES</span>. Don't brood&mdash;enjoy yourself while youth is with
you and the roses of life still bloom on your cheeks. Now! Up with the
head, and step lively&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF CEREMONIES</span>. How do you like the music, Queen?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. It's splendid, but they might play a little more <i>forte</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF CEREMONIES</span>. They are soloists, all of them, and formerly each
one of them wanted to make himself heard above the rest, and so they
have to use moderation now.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. But I asked why the seven sisters over there are not dancing.
Couldn't you, as master of ceremonies, make them do so?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF CEREMONIES</span>. I don't think it would be of any use trying, for
they are obstinate as sin&mdash;But please assume your throne, my Queen. We
are going to perform a little play in honour of the occasion&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Oh, what fun! But I want the prince to ... escort me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

fooled like that! But I haven't deserved any better, I admit.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. No, you have deserved a great deal worse. You should leave my
hunch alone, for otherwise hell breaks loose&mdash;It's a miserable thing to
see an old woman like you so foolish and so degraded. But, then, you
are to be pitied&mdash;as all of us are to be pitied.</p>

<p>ALL. We are all to be pitied!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Perhaps&mdash;in our youth&mdash;for I am old, too. You had too much
frippery on before&mdash;but now, when the disguise has been taken away&mdash;I
begin to distinguish certain features&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Don't say anything more&mdash;don't say anything more&mdash;Oh, what
have I come to&mdash;what is happening to me?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Now I know: you are my sister!</p>

dead coming back?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Everything comes back.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Am I dead or am I living?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. You may well ask that question, for I don't know the
difference. But you are exactly the same as when I parted from you
once: just as vain and just as thievish.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Do you think you are any better?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Perhaps! I am guilty of all the seven deadly sins, but you have
invented the eighth one&mdash;that of robbing the dead.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. What are you thinking of now?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Twelve years in succession I sent you money to buy a wreath for
mother's grave, and instead of buying it you kept the money.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. How do you know?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. How I came to know of it is the only thing that interests you
about that crime of yours.</p>

the desk, covering the centre of the floor, stands a big table, and on
it are placed writing-materials, inkstand, Bible, bell, and gavel</i>.</p>

<p><i>The axe of the executioner hangs on the rear wall, with a pair of
handcuffs below it and a big black crucifix above</i>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">JUDGE</span> <i>enters and makes his way into the room on tiptoe.
The bell rings. The gavel raps once on the table. All the
chairs are pulled up to the table at once. The Bible is opened.
The candles on the table become lighted</i>.</p>

<p><i>For a moment the</i> <span class="small-c">JUDGE</span> <i>stands still, stricken with horror.
Then he resumes his advance toward a huge cabinet. Suddenly the
doors of this fly open. A number of documents are thrown out,
and the</i> <span class="small-c">JUDGE</span> <i>picks them up</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. [<i>Reassured</i>] This time I am in luck! Here are the accounts
of my guardianship; here is the contract for the lease&mdash;my report as
executor&mdash;all of it! [<i>The handcuffs on the wall begin to clank</i>] Make
all the noise you please! As long as the axe stays still, I won't be
scared. [<i>He puts the documents on the table and goes back to close
the door of the cabinet, but this flies open again as soon as he shuts
it</i>] Everything has a cause: <i>ratio sufficiens</i>. This door must have
a spring with which I am not familiar. It surprises me that I don't
know it, but it cannot scare me. [<i>The axe moves on the wall</i>] The axe
moved&mdash;as a rule, that foretells an execution, but to-day it means only
that its equilibrium has become disturbed in some way. Oh, no, nothing
will give me pause but seeing my own ghost&mdash;for that would be beyond
the tricks of any charlatan.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">GHOST</span> <i>enters from behind the cabinet; the figure
resembles in every way the</i> <span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>, <i>but where the eyes should
be appear two white surfaces, as on a plaster bust</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. [<i>Frightened</i>] Who are you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GHOST</span>. I am not&mdash;I have been. I have been that unrighteous judge who is
now come here to receive his sentence.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. What have you done then, poor man?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GHOST</span>. Everything wrong that an unrighteous judge might do. Pray for
me, you whose conscience is clear&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Am I&mdash;to pray for you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GHOST</span>. Yes, you who have caused no innocent blood to be shed&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. That's true; that's something I haven't done. And besides, as
I have always obeyed the letter of the law, I have good reason to let
myself be called a righteous judge&mdash;yes, without irony!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GHOST</span>. It would, indeed, be a bad moment for joking, as the Invisible
Ones are sitting in judgment&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. What do you mean? Who are sitting in judgment?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GHOST</span>. [<i>Pointing to the table</i>] You don't see them, but I do. [<i>The
bell rings; a chair is pushed back from the table</i>] Pray for me!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. No, I won't. Justice must take its course. You must have been a
great offender to reach consciousness of your guilt so late.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GHOST</span>. You are as stern as a good conscience.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. That's just the word for it. Stern, but just!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GHOST</span>. No pity, then?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. None whatever.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GHOST</span>. No mercy?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. No mercy!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The gavel raps on the table; the chairs are pushed away</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">GHOST</span>. Now the verdict is being delivered. Can't you hear?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. I hear nothing.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GHOST</span>. [<i>Pointing to the table</i>] And you see nothing? Don't you see the
beheaded sailor, the surveyor, the chimney-sweep, the lady in white,
the tenant&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. I see absolutely nothing.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GHOST</span>. Woe unto you, then, when your eyes become opened as mine have
been. Now the verdict has been given: guilty!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Guilty!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GHOST</span>. You have said it&mdash;yourself! And you have already been sentenced.
All that remains now is the big auction.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="small-c">AMELIA</span>. [<i>Dressed as a scrub-woman</i>] Before my mother left, she ordered
me to clean the hallway and the stairs. It is winter now, and cold, and
I cannot say that it has been any pleasure to carry out her order&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. So you didn't get any pleasure out of it? Well, my child, I
must say that you demand rather too much of yourself. But as you have
obeyed, and stood the test, your time of trial shall be over, and I
will let you know your life's secret.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AMELIA</span>. Speak out, neighbour, for I dare hardly trust my good
resolutions much longer.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. Well, then! The woman you have been calling mother is your
stepmother. Your father married her when you were only one year old.
And the reason you have never seen your mother is that she died when
you were born.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AMELIA</span>. So that was it!&mdash;How strange to have had a mother and yet never
to have seen her! Tell me&mdash;did you ever see her?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. I knew her.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AMELIA</span>. How did she look?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. Well, how <i>did</i>, she look?&mdash;Her eyes were blue as the
blossom of the flax&mdash;her hair was yellow as the dry stalks of wheat&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AMELIA</span>. And tall and slender&mdash;and her hand was small and white as if it
had touched nothing but silk in all her days&mdash;and her mouth was shaped
like a heart, and her lips looked as if none but good words had ever
passed them.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. How can you know all that?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AMELIA</span>. Because that is the image which appears in my dreams when I
have not been good&mdash;And then she raises her hand as if to warn me, and
on one of her fingers there is a ring with a green stone that seems to
radiate light. It is she!&mdash;Tell me, neighbour, is there a picture of
her in the place?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. There used to be one, but I don't know whether it's still
here.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AMELIA</span>. So this one is my stepmother? Well, God was good when he let me
keep my mother's image free from stain&mdash;and hereafter I shall find it
quite natural that this other woman is cruel to me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. Cruel stepmothers exist to make children kind. And you were
not kind, Amelia, but you have become so, and for that reason I shall
now give you a Christmas present in advance.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>He takes the portrait of the</i> <span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span> <i>out of its frame, when
in its place appears a picture in water-colours corresponding
to the description given above</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">AMELIA</span>. [<i>Kneeling in front of the picture</i>] My mother&mdash;mother of my
dreams! [<i>Rising</i>] But how can I keep the picture when it is to be sold
at auction?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. You can, because the auction has already taken place.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AMELIA</span>. Where and when was it held?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. It was held elsewhere&mdash;in a place not known to you&mdash;and
to-day the things are merely to be taken away.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AMELIA</span>. What a lot of queer things are happening! And how full of
secrets the house is!&mdash;But tell me, where is my stepmother? I have not
seen her in a long time.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. I suppose it must be told: she is in a place from which
nobody returns.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AMELIA</span>. Is she dead?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. She is dead. She was found frozen to death in a swamp into
which she had stumbled.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AMELIA</span>. Merciful God have pity on her soul!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. So he will in time, especially if you pray for her.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AMELIA</span>. Of course I will.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. How good you have become, my child&mdash;as a result of her
becoming so bad!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AMELIA</span>. Don't say so now when she is dead&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. Right you are! Let her rest in peace!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AMELIA</span>. But where is my father?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. That's a secret to all of us. But it is sweet of you to ask
for him before you ask for your own Adolph.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AMELIA</span>. Adolph&mdash;yes, where is he? The children are crying for him, and
Christmas is near.&mdash;Oh, what a Christmas this will be to us!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. Leave to each day its own trouble&mdash;and now take your
Christmas present and go. The affairs connected with the auction are to
be settled, and then you'll hear news.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AMELIA</span>. [<i>Takes the portrait of her mother</i>] I go, but no longer
alone&mdash;and I have a feeling that something good is about to happen, but
what I cannot tell.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>She goes out to the right</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>. But I know! Yet you had better go, for what is about to
happen here should not be seen by children.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>He opens the door in the rear and rings a bell to summon
the people to the auction. The people enter in the following
order</i>: <span class="small-c">THE POOR</span>, <i>a large number of them; the</i> <span class="small-c">SAILOR</span>; <i>the</i>
<span class="small-c">CHIMNEY-SWEEP</span>; <i>the</i> <span class="small-c">NEIGHBOUR</span>, who takes his place in front
of the rest; <i>the</i> <span class="small-c">WIDOW</span> <i>and the</i> <span class="small-c">FATHERLESS CHILDREN</span>; <i>the</i>
<span class="small-c">SURVEYOR</span>; <span class="small-c">THE OTHER ONE</span>, <i>carrying the auctioneer's hammer and
a pile of documents</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OTHER ONE</span>. [<i>Takes his place at the table and raps with the
hammer</i>] At a compulsory auction held at the court-house for the
disposal of property left by the late circuit judge, the items now to
be described were bid in by the Court on behalf of absent creditors,
and may now be obtained and taken away by their respective owners.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. [<i>Enters, looking very aged and miserable</i>] In the name of the
law&mdash;hold!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OTHER ONE</span>. [<i>Pretends to throw something at the</i> <span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>, <i>who
stands aghast and speechless</i>] Don't speak of the law! Here the Gospel
is preached&mdash;but not for you, who wanted to buy heaven with stolen
money.&mdash;First: the widow and her fatherless children. There is the
silver set which the judge accepted from you for his false report
as executor. In his stained hands the silver has turned black, but
I hope that in yours it will once more turn white.&mdash;Then we come to
the ward, who had to become a chimney-sweep, after being cheated out
of his inheritance. Here are the receipted bills and the property
due to you from your guardian. And you need not thank him for his
accounting.&mdash;Here stands the surveyor who, although he was innocent,
had to serve two years in prison because he had made an illegal
partition&mdash;the maps handed to him for the purpose having been falsified
in advance. What can you do for him, Judge? Can you undo what has
happened, or restore his lost honour?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Oh, that fellow&mdash;give him a bill and he'll be satisfied! His
honour wasn't worth a penny, anyhow.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OTHER ONE</span>. [<i>Slaps the</i> <span class="small-c">JUDGE</span> <i>on the mouth, while the rest spit at
him and mutter with clinched fists</i>] Here is the brother of the sailor
who was beheaded in spite of his innocence. Can you restore his brother
to life? No! And you cannot pay for his life with yours, as it is not
worth as much.&mdash;And finally we come to the neighbour whom you cheated
out of his property in a perfectly legal way. Not familiar with the
tricks of the law, the neighbour has, contrary to prevailing practice,
placed the judge's son-in-law in charge of the property as life tenant,
wiping out his previous indebtedness and making him also legal heir to
the property.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. I appeal to a higher court!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OTHER ONE</span>. This case has passed through all the instances except
the highest, and that far you cannot reach with your stamped papers.
For if you tried, all these poor people whom you have robbed of their
living would cry out: Guilty!&mdash;Thus we are done with all that could be
properly disposed of. What remains here still undisposed of goes to the
poor: clocks, vases, jewelry and other valuables that have served as
bribes, graft, tips, souvenirs&mdash;all in a perfectly legal way because
evidence and witnesses were wanting. You poor, take back your own!
Your tears have washed the guilt from the ill-gotten goods. [<i>The</i> <span class="small-c">POOR</span>
<i>begin to plunder</i>] And now remains the last item to be sold by me.
This pauper here, formerly a judge, is offered to the lowest bidder for
board at the expense of the parish. How much is offered? [<i>Silence</i>]
No offer? [<i>Silence</i>] First, second, third time&mdash;no offer? [<i>To the</i>
<span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>] There, you see! Nobody wants you. Well, then, I have to take you
myself and send you to your well-earned punishment.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Is there no atonement?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OTHER ONE</span>. Yes, punishment atones.&mdash;Take him into the woods and
stone him in accordance with the law of Moses&mdash;for no other law was
ever known to him. Away with him! [<i>The people pounce on the</i> <span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>
<i>and jostle him</i>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The scene changes to the "waiting-room." The same setting as
in the second scene of the fourth act: a kettle-shaped chasm

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. [<i>Staring in front of himself as if lost in a dream</i>]
Hush!&mdash;I had a dream! They were throwing stones at me&mdash;and yet I
felt no pain&mdash;and then everything turned black and vacant until this
moment&mdash;How long it may have lasted, I cannot tell&mdash;Now I am beginning
to hear again&mdash;and to feel. It feels as if I were being carried&mdash;oh,
how cold it is&mdash;they are washing me, I think&mdash;I am lying in something
that has six sides like a cell in a honeycomb and that smells like a
carpenter shop&mdash;I am being carried, and a bell is ringing&mdash;Wait! Now I
am riding, but not in a street-car, although the bell is ringing all
the time&mdash;Now I am sinking down, down, as if I were drowning&mdash;boom,
boom, boom: three knocks on the roof&mdash;and then the lessons begin&mdash;the
teacher is leading&mdash;and now the boys are singing&mdash;What can it be?&mdash;And
then they are knocking on the roof again, incessantly&mdash;boom, boom,
boom, boom, boom, boom&mdash;silence&mdash;it's over! [<i>He wakes up</i>] Where am I?
I choke! It's so stuffy and close here!&mdash;Oh, it's you!&mdash;Where are we?
Whose bust is that?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. They say it is the new god.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. But he looks like a goat.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Perhaps it is the god of the goats?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. "The goats on the left side&mdash;" What is that I am recalling?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">PRINCE</span>. It is the god Pan.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Pan?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Exactly! Just exactly! And when, in the night, the
shepherds&mdash;no, not <i>those</i> shepherds&mdash;catch sight of a hair of his hide
they are seized with panic&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. [<i>Rising</i>] Woe! I don't want to stay here! Woe! Can't I get out
of here? I want to get out!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>He runs around, looking vainly for a way out.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OTHER ONE</span>. [<i>Enters dressed as a Franciscan friar</i>] You'll find
nothing but entrances&mdash;no exits!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Are you Father Colomba?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OTHER ONE</span>. No, I am The Other One.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. As a monk?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OTHER ONE</span>. Don't you know that The Other One turns monk when he
grows old; and don't you think it is well that he does so some time?
But, seriously speaking&mdash;for here everything is serious&mdash;this is my
holiday attire, which I am permitted to wear only this one day of the
year in order that I may remember what I have had and what I have lost.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. [<i>Alarmed</i>] What day of the year is it to-day?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OTHER ONE</span>. [<i>Bending his head with a sigh</i>] It is Christmas Eve!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. [<i>Approaching the</i> <span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>] Think of it, it is Christmas
Eve?&mdash;And you know I don't dare to ask where we are&mdash;I dare not&mdash;but
let us go home, home to our children, to our own&mdash;&mdash; [<i>He cries</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Yes, let us go from here, home to ourselves, that we may
start a new life in peace and harmony&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Oh, dear, sweet fellow&mdash;help us, have mercy on us, forgive us!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OTHER ONE</span>. It is too late!</p>

Don't ask him where we are; I don't want to know! But one thing I do
want to know: will there ever be an end to this?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OTHER ONE</span>. Never!&mdash;That word "end" is not known to us here.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. [<i>Crushed</i>] No end! [<i>Looking around</i>] And does the sun never
enter this place of damp and cold?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OTHER ONE</span>. Never, for those who dwell here have not loved the sun!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. It is true: I have cursed the sun.&mdash;May I confess my sins?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OTHER ONE</span>. No, you must keep them to yourself until they begin to

squeamish here, but bang away without regard for legal forms.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Are they beating carpets out there&mdash;on a day like this?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. No, it is an extra ration of rod all around as a reminder for
those who may have forgotten the significance of the day.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Do they actually lay hands on our persons? Is it possible that
educated people can do things like that to each other?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. This is a place of education for the badly educated; and those
who have behaved like scoundrels are treated like such.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. But this passes all limits!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Yes, because here we are in the limitless! Now get ready! I
have already been out there and had my portion.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. [<i>Appalled</i>] What humiliation! That's to strip you of all human
worth!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Ha ha! Human worth! Ha ha!&mdash;Look at the scales over there.
That's where the human worth is&mdash;and invariably found wanting.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. [<i>Sits down at the table</i>] I could never have believed&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. No, you could only believe in your caul and your own
righteousness. And yet you had both Moses and the Prophets and more
besides&mdash;for the very dead walked for your benefit.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. The children! The children! Is it not possible to send them a
word of greeting and of warning?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. No! Eternally, no!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">WITCH</span> <i>comes forward with a big basketful of
stereoscopes.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. What is it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WITCH</span>. Christmas gifts for the righteous. Stereoscopes, you know.
[<i>Handing out one</i>] Help yourself. They don't cost anything.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. There's a kind soul at last. And a little attention to a man of
my age and rank does honour both to your tact and to your heart&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WITCH</span>. That's very nice of you, Judge, but I hope you don't mind my
having given some thought to the others, too.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. [<i>Disappointed</i>] Are you poking fun at me, you damned old hag?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WITCH</span>. [<i>Spitting in his face</i>] Hold your tongue, petti-fogger!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. What company I have got into!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WITCH</span>. Is it not good enough for you, you old perjurer, you grafter,
you forger, you robber of orphans, you false pleader? Now have a look
in the peep-show and take in the great spectacle: "From the Cradle to
the Grave." There is your whole biography and all your victims&mdash;just
have a look now. That's right!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span> <i>looks in the stereoscope; then he rises with horror stamped on
his face</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WITCH</span>. I hope this slight attention may add to the Christmas joy!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>She hands a stereoscope to the</i> <span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>, <i>and proceeds
thereafter to give one to each person present</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. [<i>Sitting at the table, where now the</i> <span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span> <i>takes a seat
opposite him</i>] What do you see?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Everything is there; everything!&mdash;And do you notice that
everything is black? All life that seemed so bright is now black, and
even moments which I thought full of innocent joy have an appearance
of something nauseating, foul, almost criminal. It is as if all my
memories had decayed, including the fairest among them&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. You are right. There is not one memory that can bring light into
this darkness. When I look at her who was the first love of my youth,
I see nothing but a corpse. When I think of my sweet Amelia, there
appears&mdash;a harlot. The little ones make faces at me like gutter-snipes.
My court has become a pigsty; the vineyard, a rubbish-heap full of
thistles; and the mausoleum&mdash;Oh, horrors!&mdash;an outhouse! When I think of
the green woods, the leafage appears snuff-coloured and the trunks look
bleached as mast tops. The blue river seems to flow out of a dung-heap
and the blue arch above it looks like a smoky roof&mdash;Of the sun itself I
can recall nothing but the name; and what was called the moon&mdash;the lamp
that shed its light on bays and groves during the amorous nights of my
youth&mdash;I can remember only as&mdash;no, I cannot remember it at all. But
the words are left, although they have only sound without sense.&mdash;Love,
wine, song! Flowers, children, happiness!&mdash;Don't the words sound
pretty? And it is all that is left!&mdash;Love? What <i>was</i> it, anyhow?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. What was it?&mdash;Two cats on a back-yard fence.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. [<i>Sheepishly</i>] Yes, that's it! That's what it was! Three dogs on
a sidewalk. What a sweet recollection!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. [<i>Pressing his hand</i>] Yes, it is sweet!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. [<i>Looking at his watch</i>] My watch has stopped. I am so
hungry&mdash;and I am thirsty, too, and I long for a smoke. But I am also
tired and want to sleep. All my desires are waking. They claw at me and
hound me, but not one of them can I satisfy. We are lost! Lost, indeed!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. And I long for a cup of tea more than I can tell!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Hot green tea&mdash;that's just what I should like now&mdash;with a tiny
drop of rum in it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. No, not rum! I should prefer some cakes&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. [<i>Who has drawn near to listen</i>] Sugared, of course? I fear
you'll have to whistle for them.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. Oh, this dreadful language hurts me more than anything, else.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. That's because you don't know yet how something else is going
to hurt you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. What is that?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. No, don't! We don't want to know! Please!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Yes, I am going to tell. It begins with&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. [<i>Puts her fingers in her ears and cries out</i>] Mercy! Don't,
don't, don't!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Yes, I will&mdash;and as my brother-in-law is curious, I'll tell it
to him. The second letter is&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. This uncertainty is worse than torture&mdash;Speak out, you devil, or
I'll kill you!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Kill, ha ha! Everybody is immortal here, body and soul, what
little there is left. However, the third letter is&mdash;and that's all
you'll know!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MAN IN GREY</span>. [<i>A small, lean man with grey clothes, grey face, black
lips, grey beard, and grey hands; he speaks in a very low voice</i>] May I
speak a word with you, madam?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. [<i>Rising in evident alarm</i>] What is it about?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MAN IN GREY</span>. [<i>Smiling a ghastly, malicious smile</i>] I'll tell&mdash;out
there.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD LADY</span>. [<i>Crying</i>] No, no; I won't!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MAN IN GREY</span>. [<i>Laughing</i>]; It isn't dangerous. Come along! All I want
is to <i>speak</i> to you. Come now!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>They go toward the background and disappear</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. [<i>To the</i> <span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>] A little Christmas entertainment is wholesome.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Do you mean to maltreat a woman?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. Here all injustices are abolished, and woman is treated as the
equal of man.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. You devil!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. That's all right, but don't call me hunchback, for that touches
my last illusion.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OTHER ONE</span>. [<i>Steps up to the table</i>] Well, how do you like our
animal magnetism? It <i>can</i> work wonders on black-guards!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. I understand nothing of all this.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OTHER ONE</span>. That's just what is meant, and it is very nice of you to
admit that there are things you don't understand.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Granting that I am now in the realm of the dead&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OTHER ONE</span>. Say "hell," for that is what it's called.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. [<i>Stammering</i>] Th-then I should like to remind you that He who
once descended here to redeem all lost&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span>. [<i>At a sign from</i> <span class="small-c">THE OTHER ONE</span> <i>he strikes the</i> <span class="small-c">JUDGE</span> <i>in the
face</i>] Don't argue!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. They won't even listen to me! It is beyond despair! No mercy, no
hope, no end!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OTHER ONE</span>. Quite right! Here you find only justice and
retribution&mdash;especially justice: an eye for an eye and a tooth for a
tooth! Just as you wanted it!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. But among men there is pardon&mdash;and that you don't have here.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OTHER ONE</span>. Monarchs alone possess the right to pardon. And as a man
of law you ought to know that a petition for pardon must be submitted
before it can be granted.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. For me there can be no pardon!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OTHER ONE</span>. [<i>Gives the</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCE</span> <i>a sign to step aside</i>] You feel,
then, that your guilt is too great?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OTHER ONE</span>. Then I'll speak kindly to you. There is an end, you see,
if there is a beginning. And you have made a beginning. But the sequel
will be long and hard.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Oh, God is good!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OTHER ONE</span>. You have said it!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. But&mdash;there is one thing that cannot be undone&mdash;there is one!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OTHER ONE</span>. You are thinking of the monstrance which should have
been of gold but was of silver? Well, don't you think that He who
changed water into wine may also change silver into gold?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. [<i>On his knees</i>] But my misdeed is too great, too great to be
forgiven.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OTHER ONE</span>. Now you overestimate yourself again. But rise up. We
are about to celebrate Christmas in our own fashion.&mdash;The light of the
sun cannot reach here, as you know&mdash;nor that of the moon. But on this
night, and on this alone, a star rises so far above the rocks that it
is visible from here. It is the star that went before the shepherds
through the desert&mdash;and <i>that</i> was the morning star.</p>

<h4>FIRST SCENE</h4>


<blockquote>

<p><i>The front of a modern house with a basement of granite. The
upper parts are of brick covered with yellow plastering. The
window-frames and other ornaments are of sandstone. A low
archway leads through the basement to the court and serves also
as entrance to the confectioner's shop. The corner of the house
appears at the right of the stage, where the avenue opens into
a small square planted with roses and various other flowers. At
the corner is a mail-box. The main floor, above the basement,
has large windows, all of which are open. Four of these windows
belong to an elegantly furnished dining-room. The four middle
windows in the second story have red shades which are drawn;
the shades are illumined by light from within</i>.</p>

<p><i>Along the front of the house runs a sidewalk with trees
planted at regular intervals. There is a lamp-post in the
extreme foreground and beside it stands a green bench</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>, <i>the confectioner, comes out with a chair and sits down
on the sidewalk</i>.</p>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">MASTER</span> <i>is visible in the dining-room of the main floor,
seated at the table. Behind him appears an oven built of green
majolica tiles. On its mantelshelf stands a large photograph
between two candelabra and some vases containing flowers. A
young girl in a light dress is just serving the final course</i>.</p>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">MASTER'S</span> <i>brother, the</i> CONSUL, <i>appears in front of the
house, coming from the left, and knocks with his walking-stick
on the sill of one of the dining-room windows</i>.</p></blockquote>
<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Will you soon be through?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. I'll come in a moment.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. [<i>Saluting the confectioner</i>] Good evening, Mr. Starck. It's
still hot&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. Good evening, Consul. Yes, it's the dog-day heat, and we have
been making jam all day.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Is that so? It's a good year for fruit, then?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. It might be worse. Well, the spring was cold, but the summer
turned out unbearably hot. It was hard on us who had to stay in the
city.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. I got back from the country yesterday&mdash;one begins to wish
oneself back when the evenings grow dark.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. Neither I nor my wife have been out of the city. Of course,
business is at a standstill, but you have to be on hand to make
ready for the winter. First come strawberries, then cherries, then
raspberries, and last gooseberries, cantaloupes and all the fall
fruits&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Tell me something, Mr. Starck. Is the house here to be sold?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. Not that I have heard.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. There are a lot of people living here?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. Something like ten families, I think, counting those in the
rear also. But nobody knows anybody else. There is unusually little
gossiping in the house. It seems rather as if everybody were hiding. I
have lived here ten years, and during the first two years we had for
neighbours a strange family that kept very quiet in the daytime. But at
night they began to stir about, and then carriages would come and fetch
things away. Not until the end of the second year did I learn that
they had been running a private sanatorium, and that what was being
taken away at night were dead bodies.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Horrible!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. And they call it the Silent House.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Yes, there isn't much talking done here.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. More than one drama has been played here, nevertheless.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Tell me, Mr. Starck, who lives up there on the second floor,
right above my brother?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. Up there, where the light comes through the red shades&mdash;a
tenant died there during the summer. Then the place stood empty for a
month, and a week ago a new family moved in. I haven't seen them. I
don't know their name. I don't think they ever go out. Why did you ask,
Consul?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Whew&mdash;I don't know! Those four red shades look like stage
curtains behind which some sanguinary tragedies are being rehearsed&mdash;or
I imagine so, at least. There is a palm at one of the windows looking
like a rod made of wire&mdash;you can see the shadow of it on the shade. If
only some people were to be seen&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. I have seen plenty of them, but not until later&mdash;at night.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Was it men or women you saw?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. Both, I guess&mdash;but now I must get back to my pots. [<i>He
disappears into the gateway</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. [<i>Still inside, has risen from the table and lighted a cigar;
he is now standing at the open window, talking to his brother outside</i>]
I'll be ready in a moment. Louise is only going to sew a button on one
of my gloves.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Then you mean to go down-town?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Perhaps we'll take a turn in that direction&mdash;Whom were you
talking with?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Just the confectioner&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Oh, yes&mdash;a very decent fellow&mdash;and, for that matter, my only
companion here during the summer.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Have you really stayed at home every night&mdash;never gone out?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Never! Those light evenings make me timid. They are pleasant in
the country, of course, but here in the city they produce the effect of
something unnatural&mdash;almost ghastly. But no sooner has the first street
lamp been lighted than I feel calm once more and can resume my evening
walks. In that way I can get tired and sleep better at night. [<span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>
<i>hands him the glove</i>] Thank you, my child. You can just as well leave
the windows open, as there are no mosquitoes. [<i>To the</i> <span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>] Now I'm
coming.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>A few moments later he can be seen coming out of the house
on the side facing the square; he stops at the corner to drop
a letter in the mail-box; then he comes around the corner to
the front of the house and sits down on the bench beside his
brother</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. But tell me: why do you stay in the city when you <i>could</i> be in
the country?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. I don't know. I have lost my power of motion. My memory has
tied me for ever to these rooms. Only within them can I find peace and
protection. In there&mdash;yes! It is interesting to look at your own home
from the outside. Then I imagine that some other man is pacing back and
forth in there&mdash;Just think: for ten years I have been pacing back and
forth in there!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Is it ten years now?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Yes, time goes quickly&mdash;once it is gone. But when it is still
going it seems slow enough.&mdash;That time the house was new. I watched
them putting down the hard-wood floor in the dining-room and painting
the doors; and <i>she</i> was permitted to pick out the wall-paper, which
is still there&mdash;Yes, that was then! The confectioner and I are the
oldest tenants in the place, and he, too, has had a few experiences of
his own&mdash;he is one of those people who never succeed but are always in
some kind of trouble. In a way, I have been living his life also, and
bearing his burdens besides my own.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Does he drink, then?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. No-o&mdash;nothing of that kind, but there is no <i>go</i> to him. Well,
he and I know the history of this house: how they have arrived in
bridal coaches and left in hearses, while the mail-box at the corner
became the recipient of all their confidences.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. There was a death here in the middle of the summer, wasn't
there?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Yes, a case of typhoid&mdash;the man was manager of a bank&mdash;and then
the flat stood vacant for a month. The coffin came out first, then the
widow and the children, and last of all the furniture.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. That was on the second floor?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Yes, up there, where you see the light&mdash;where those new people
are, about whom I know nothing at all.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Haven't you seen anything of them either?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. I never ask any questions about the other tenants. What comes
to me unasked, I accept&mdash;but I never make any wrong use of it, and I
never interfere, for I am anxious for the peace of my old age.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Old age&mdash;yes! I think it's nice to grow old, for then there
isn't so much left to be recorded.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Indeed, it is nice. I am settling my accounts, both with life
and with people, and I have already begun to pack for the journey.
Of course, the solitude has its draw-backs, but when there is nobody
who can make any demands on you, then you have won your freedom&mdash;the
freedom to come and go, to think and act, to eat and sleep, in
accordance with your own choice.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. They are astir up there&mdash;did you see?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Yes, there is such a lot of mystery about it&mdash;and at night it
is worse than ever. Sometimes there is music, but it's always bad;
and sometimes I think they are playing cards; and long after midnight
carriages drive up and take away people.&mdash;I never make a complaint
against other tenants, for then they want to get even, and nobody wants
to change his ways. The best thing is to remain oblivious of everything.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. It looked to me like circulars.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. But who is he?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Why, that's the new tenant up there on the second floor.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Oh, is that so! What do you think he looked like?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. I don't know. Musician, conductor, a touch of musical
comedy, with a leaning to vaudeville&mdash;gambler&mdash;Adonis&mdash;a little of
everything&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Black hair should have gone with that pale complexion of
his, but his hair was brown&mdash;which means that it had been dyed, or
that he wears a wig. A tuxedo at home indicates an empty wardrobe,
and the movements of his hands as he dropped the letters into the
box suggested shuffling and cutting and dealing&mdash;[<i>At this moment

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Isn't she going to marry?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Not that I know of.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Is there no fiancÃ© in sight?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Why do you ask?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Have you had any thoughts of that kind?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. I? No, thank you! When I married the last time I was not too
old, as we had a child in due time, but I have grown too old since
then, and now I want to spend my evening in peace&mdash;Do you think I want
another master in my own house, who would rob me of life and honour and
goods?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Oh, nobody took your life or your goods&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Do you mean to say that my honour suffered any harm?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Don't you know?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. What <i>do</i> you mean?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. In leaving you, she killed your honour.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Then I have been a dead man for five years without knowing it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. You haven't known it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. No, but now I'll tell you in a few words what really happened.
When, at fifty, I married a girl much younger than myself&mdash;one whose
heart I had won and who gave me her hand fearlessly and willingly&mdash;then
I promised her that if ever my age should become a burden to her youth
I would go my own way and give her back her freedom. Since the child
had come in due time, and neither one of us wanted another, and since
our little girl had begun to grow apart from me, so that I had come to
feel superfluous, I did go my way&mdash;that is, I took a boat, as we were
living on an island&mdash;and that was the end of the whole story. I had
redeemed my promise and saved my honour&mdash;what more besides?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. All right&mdash;but she thought it an attack on her own honour,
because she had meant to go away herself. And so she killed you by
tacit accusations which never reached your ears.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Did she accuse herself also?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. No, she had no reason to do so.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Then no harm has been done.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Do you know what has become of her and the child since then?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. I don't want to know! Having at last outlived the horrors of
longing, I came to regard the whole business as buried; and as none but
beautiful memories were left behind in our rooms, I remained where I
was. However, I thank you for that piece of valuable information!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Which one?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. That she had no reason for self-accusation, for if she had it
would constitute an accusation against me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. I think you are living under a serious misconception&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. If I am, leave me alone! A clear conscience&mdash;comparatively
clear, at least&mdash;has always been the diving-suit that has enabled me
to descend into the vast deeps without being suffocated. [<i>Rising</i>]
To think of it&mdash;that I got out of it with my life! And now it's all
over!&mdash;Suppose we take a turn down the avenue?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. All right, then we can see them light the first street lamp of
the season.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. But won't the moon be up to-night&mdash;the harvest-moon?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Why, I think the moon is full just now&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. [<i>Going to one of the windows and talking into the
dining-room</i>] Please hand me my stick, Louise. The light one&mdash;I just
want to hold it in my hand.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. [<i>Handing out a cane of bamboo</i>] Here it is, sir.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Thank you, my girl. Now turn out the light in the dining-room
if you have nothing to do there. We'll be gone a little while&mdash;I cannot
tell just how long.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. Good evening, Miss Louise. It's awfully hot!&mdash;So your gentlemen
have disappeared?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. They have gone for a stroll down the avenue&mdash;the first time my
master has gone out this summer.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. We old people love the twilight, which covers up so many
defects both in ourselves and others. Do you know, Miss Louise, my old
woman is getting blind, but she won't have an operation performed. She
says there is nothing to look at, and that sometimes she wishes she
were deaf, too.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. Well, one does feel that way&mdash;at times.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. Of course, you are leading a very quiet life in there, with
plenty of everything, and nothing to worry about. I have never heard a
loud voice or the slamming of a door&mdash;perhaps, even, it is a little too
quiet for a young lady like yourself?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. Not at all! I love the quiet, and whatever is dignified,
graceful, measured&mdash;with nobody blurting out things, and all thinking
it a duty to overlook the less pleasant features of daily life.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. And you have never any company?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. No, only the consul comes here&mdash;and the like of the love
between those two brothers I have never seen.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. Who is the elder of the two?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. That's more than I can tell. Whether there is a year or two
between them, or they are twins, I don't know, for they treat each
other with mutual respect, as if each one of them was the elder brother.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">AGNES</span> <i>appears, trying to get past</i> <span class="small-c">STARCK</span> <i>without being seen

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. Where are you going, girl?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AGNES</span>. Oh, I am just going out for a little walk.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. That's right, but get back soon.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">AGNES</span> <i>goes out</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. Do you think your master is still mourning the loss of his dear
ones?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. He doesn't mourn&mdash;he doesn't even feel any regrets, for he
doesn't want them back&mdash;but he is always with them in his memory, where
he keeps only their beautiful traits.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. But doesn't the fate of his daughter trouble him at times?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. Yes, he cannot help fearing that the mother may have married
again, and then, of course, everything depends on how the child's
stepfather turns out.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. I have been told that the wife refused alimony at first, but
that now, when five years have passed, she has sent him a lawyer with a
demand for many thousands&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. [<i>With reserve</i>] I know nothing about it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. I believe, however, that she was never more beautiful than in
his memory&mdash;&mdash;</p>

Excuse me, but does Mr. Fischer live here?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. Mr. Fischer? Not so far as I know.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. Perhaps Fischer is the name of that fellow on the second floor?
Around the corner&mdash;one flight up.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. Carrying up bottles again&mdash;that means another sleepless night.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. What kind of people are they? Why don't they ever show
themselves?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. I suppose they use the back-stairs, for I have never seen them.
But I do hear them.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. Yes, I have also heard doors bang and corks pop&mdash;and the
popping of other things, too, I guess.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. And they never open their windows, in spite of the heat&mdash;they
must be Southerners.&mdash;Why, that's lightning&mdash;a lot of it!&mdash;I guess
it's nothing but heat-lightning, for there has been no thunder.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. He wanted to telephone, and I was to go ahead. Well, I suppose
he'll be here soon.&mdash;What's this? [<i>He stoops to pick up a post-card</i>]
What does it say?&mdash;"Boston club at midnight: Fischer."&mdash;Do you know who
Fischer is, Louise?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. There was a man with a lot of wine looking for Fischer a while
ago&mdash;up on the second floor.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. On the second floor&mdash;Fischer! Red shades that make the place
look like a drug-store window at night! I fear you have got bad company
in the house.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. What is a Boston club?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Oh, there need be no harm in it at all&mdash;in this case I don't
know, however.&mdash;But how did the post-card&mdash;? Oh, it was <i>he</i> who
dropped it a while ago. Then I'll put it back in the box.&mdash;Fischer?
I have heard that name before. In connection with something I cannot
recall just now&mdash;May I ask a question, Miss Louise: does my brother
never speak of&mdash;the past?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. Not to me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Miss Louise&mdash;one more question <span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. Excuse me, but here
comes the milk, and I have to receive it. [<i>She leaves the dining-room</i>.</p>

the city isn't pleasant, exactly, but up here you have quiet at least:
never any rattling carriages, and still less any street-cars&mdash;it's just
like the country.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. Of course, it's quiet, but it's too quiet for business. I
know my trade, but I am a poor salesman&mdash;have always been, and
can't learn&mdash;or it may be something else. Perhaps I haven't got the
proper manner. For when customers act as if I were a swindler I get
embarrassed at first, and then as mad as it is possible for me to
become. But nowadays I haven't the strength to get really mad. It has
been worn out of me&mdash;everything gets worn out.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Why don't you go to work for somebody else?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. Who would want me?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Have you ever tried?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. What would be the use of it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Oh&mdash;well!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>At this moment a long-drawn "O-oh" is heard from the apartment

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. What, in the name of Heaven, are they up to in that place? Are
they killing each other?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. I don't like this new and unknown element that has come into
the house. It is pressing on us like a red thunder-cloud. What kind of
people are they? Where do they come from? What do they want here?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. It's so very dangerous to delve in other people's affairs&mdash;you
get mixed up in them yourself&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Do you know anything about them?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. No, I don't know anything at all.</p>

in the bed over there? He brought the soil himself, in a basket,
don't you remember? Don't you recognise your blue gentians and the
mignonette, your <i>Malmaison</i> and <i>Merveille de Lyons</i> roses, which he
budded himself? Don't you understand that he has cherished the memory
of yourself and of the child?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. Where is he now?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Taking a walk along the avenue, but he will be here in a few
minutes with the evening papers. When he comes from that side he uses
the back door, and he goes straight into the dining-room to read the
papers. Stand still and he won't notice you.&mdash;But you must go back to
your own rooms&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. I can't! I can't go back to that man.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Who is he, and what?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. He&mdash;has been a singer.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Has been&mdash;and what is he now? An adventurer?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. Yes!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Keeps a gambling-house?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. Yes!</p>

<p><span class="small-c"><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span></span>. And the child? Bait?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. Oh, don't say that!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. It's horrible!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. You are too harsh about the whole thing.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Of course, filth must be handled gently&mdash;so very gently! But
a just cause should be dragged in the dirt. Why did you defile his
honour, and why did you lure me into becoming your accomplice? I was
childish enough to trust your word, and I defended your unjust cause
against his.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. You forget that he was too old.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. No, he wasn't <i>then</i>, as you had a child at once. When he
proposed, he asked if you wanted to have a child with him, and he vowed
in the bargain to give you back your freedom when his promise had been
kept and old age began to weigh him down.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. He deserted me, and that was an insult.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Not to you! Your youth prevented it from being a reflection on
you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. He should have let me leave him.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Why? Why did you want to heap dishonour on him?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. One of us had to bear it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. What strange paths your thoughts pursue! However, you have
killed him, and fooled me into helping you. How can we rehabilitate him?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. If he is to be rehabilitated, it can only be at my expense.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. I cannot follow your thoughts, which always turn to hatred.
But suppose we leave the rehabilitation alone and think only of how his
daughter is to be saved: what can we do then?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. She is my child. She's mine by law, and my husband is her
father&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Now <i>you</i> are too harsh about it! And you have grown cruel and
vulgar&mdash;Hush! Here he comes now.</p>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">MASTER</span> <i>ceases to read and stares out through the window</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. He is looking at us!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Don't move!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. He is looking straight into my eyes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Be still! He doesn't see you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. He looks as if he were dead&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Well, he has been killed.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Carl Frederick! [<i>Coming to the window</i>] Are you alone? I
thought&mdash;Are you really alone?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. As you see.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. The air is so sultry, and the flowers give me a headache&mdash;I am
just going to finish the newspaper.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>He resumes his former position.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Now let us get at your affairs. Do you want me to go with you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. Perhaps! But it will be a hard struggle.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. But the child must be saved. And I am a lawyer.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. Well, for the child's sake, then! Come with me!</p>

<h4>SECOND SCENE</h4>


<blockquote>

<p><i>Inside the dining-room. The brick stove appears at the centre
of the rear wall. To the left of it there is a door leading
into the pantry. Another door to the right of it leads to the
hallway. At the left stands a buffet with a telephone on it. A
piano and a tall clock stand at the right. There are doors in
both side walls</i>.</p>


<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">MASTER</span> <i>is in the room, and</i> <span class="small-c">LOUISE</span> <i>enters as the
curtain rises</i>.</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />
<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Where did my brother go?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. [<i>Alarmed</i>] He was outside a moment ago. He can't be very far
away.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. What a dreadful noise they are making up above! It is as
if they were stepping on my head! Now they are pulling out bureau
drawers as if they were were preparing for a journey&mdash;running away,
perhaps.&mdash;If you only knew how to play chess, Louise!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. I know a little&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Oh, if you just know how to move the pieces, that will be
enough&mdash;Sit down, child. [<i>He sets up the chess pieces</i>] They are
carrying on up there so that they make the chandelier rattle&mdash;and the
confectioner is heating up down below. I think I'll have to move soon.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. I have long thought that you ought to do so anyhow.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Anyhow?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. It isn't good to stay too long among old memories.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Why not? As time passes, all memories grow beautiful.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. But you may live twenty years more, and that is too long a time
to live among memories which, after all, must fade and which may change
colour entirely some fine day.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. How much you know, my child!&mdash;Begin now by moving a pawn&mdash;but
not the one in front of the queen, or you will be mate in two moves.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. Then I start with the knight&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Hardly less dangerous, girl!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. But I think I'll start with the knight just the same.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. All right. Then I'll move my bishop's pawn.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span> <i>appears in the hallway, carrying a tray</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. There's Mr. Starck with the tea-cakes. He doesn't make any more
noise than a mouse.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>She rises and goes out into the hallway to receive the tray,
which she then carries into the pantry</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Well, Mr. Starck, how is the old lady?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. Oh, thank you, her eyes are about as usual.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Have you seen anything of my brother?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. He is walking back and forth outside, I think.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Has he got any company?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. No-o&mdash;I don't think so.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. It wasn't yesterday you had a look at these rooms, Mr. Starck.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. I should say not&mdash;it's just ten years ago now&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. When you brought the wedding-cake.&mdash;Does the place look changed?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. It is just as it was&mdash;the palms have grown, of course&mdash;but the
rest is just as it was.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. And will remain so until you bring the funeral cake. When you
have passed a certain age, nothing changes, nothing progresses&mdash;all the
movement is downward like that of a sleigh going down-hill.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. Yes, that's the way it is.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. And it is peaceful, the way I have it here. No love, no
friends, only a little company to break up the solitude. Then human
beings are just human beings, without any claims on your feelings and
sympathies. Then you come loose like an old tooth, and drop out without
pain or regrets. Take Louise, for instance&mdash;a pretty young girl, the
sight of whom pleases me like a work of art that I don't wish to
possess&mdash;there is nothing to disturb our relationship. My brother and I
meet like two old gentlemen who never get too close to each other and
never exact any confidences. By taking up a neutral position toward
one's fellow-men, one attains a certain distance&mdash;and as a rule we look
better at a distance. In a word, I am pleased with my old age and its
quiet peace&mdash;[<i>Calling out</i>] Louise!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. [<i>Appearing in the doorway at the left and speaking pleasantly
as always</i>] The laundry has come home, and I have to check it off.
[<i>She disappears again</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Well, Mr. Starck, won't you sit down and chat a little&mdash;or
perhaps you play chess?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. I can't stay away from my pots, and the oven has to be heated
up at eleven. It's very kind of you, however&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. If you catch sight of my brother, ask him to come in and keep
me company.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. So I will&mdash;so I will! [<i>He goes</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. [<i>Alone; moves a couple of pieces on the chess-board; then gets
up and begins to walk about</i>] The peace of old age&mdash;yes! [<i>He sits down
at the piano and strikes a few chords; then he gets up and walks about
as before</i>] Louise! Can't you let the laundry wait a little?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. [<i>Appears again for a moment in the doorway at the left</i>] No,
I can't, because the wash-woman is in a hurry&mdash;she has husband and
children waiting for her.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Oh! [<i>He sits down at the table and begins to drum with his
fingers on it; tries to read the newspaper, but tires of it; lights
matches only to blow them out again at once; looks repeatedly at the
big clock, until at last a noise is heard from the hallway</i>] Is that
you, Carl Frederick?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE MAIL-CARRIER</span>. [<i>Appears in the doorway</i>] It's the mail. Excuse me
for walking right in, but the door was standing open.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Is there a letter for me?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE MAIL-CARRIER</span>. Only a post-card.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>He hands it over and goes out</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. [<i>Reading the post-card</i>] Mr. Fischer again! Boston club!
That's the man up above&mdash;with the white hands and the tuxedo coat. And
to me! The impertinence of it! I have got to move!&mdash;Fischer!&mdash;[<i>He
tears up the card; again a noise is heard, in the hallway</i>] Is that
you, Carl Frederick?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE ICEMAN</span>. [<i>Without coming into the room</i>] It's the ice!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Well, it's nice to get ice in this heat. But be careful about
those bottles in the box. And put one of the pieces on edge so that I
can hear the water drip from it as it melts&mdash;That's my water-clock that
measures out the hours&mdash;the long hours&mdash;Tell me, where do you get the
ice from nowadays?&mdash;Oh, he's gone!&mdash;Everybody goes away&mdash;goes home&mdash;to
hear their own voices and get some company-[<i>Pause</i>] Is that you, Carl
Frederick?</p>

<p><i>Somebody in the apartment above plays Chopin's</i> Fantaisie Impromptu,
Opus 66, <i>on the piano</i>&mdash;<i>but only the first part of it</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. [<i>Begins to listen, is aroused, looks up at the ceiling</i>] My
<i>Impromptu</i>?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>He covers his eyes with one hand and listens</i>.</p>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">CONSUL</span> <i>enters through the hallway</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Is that you, Carl Frederick?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The music stops</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. It is I.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Where have you been so long?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. I had some business to clear up. Have you been alone?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Of course! Come and play chess now.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. I prefer to talk. And you need also to hear your own voice a
little.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. True enough&mdash;only it is so easy to get to talking about the
past.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. That makes us forget the present.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. There is no present. What's just passing is empty nothingness.
One has to look ahead or behind&mdash;and ahead is better, for there lies
hope!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. [<i>Seating himself at the table</i>] Hope&mdash;of what?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Of change.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Well! Do you mean to say you have had enough of the peace of
old age?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Perhaps.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. It's certain then. And if now you had the choice between
solitude and the past?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. No ghosts, however!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. How about your memories?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. They don't walk. They are only poems wrought by me out of
certain realities. But if dead people walk, then you have ghosts.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Well, then&mdash;in your memory&mdash;who brings you the prettiest
mirage: the woman or the child?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Both! I cannot separate them, and that's why I never tried to
keep the child.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. But do you think you did right? Did the possibility of a
stepfather never occur to you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. I didn't think that far ahead at the time, but afterward, of
course, I have had&mdash;my thoughts&mdash;about&mdash;that very thing.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. A stepfather who abused&mdash;perhaps debased&mdash;your daughter?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Hush!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. What is it you hear?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. I thought I heard the "little steps"&mdash;those little steps that
came tripping down the corridor when she was looking for me.&mdash;It was
the child that was the best of all! To watch that fearless little
creature, whom nothing could frighten, who never suspected that life
might be deceptive, who had no secrets! I recall her first experience
of the malice that is in human beings. She caught sight of a pretty
child down in the park, and, though it was strange to her, she went
up to it with open arms to kiss it&mdash;and the pretty child rewarded her
friendliness by biting her in the cheek first and then making a face
at her. Then you should have seen my little Anne-Charlotte. She stood
as if turned to stone. And it wasn't pain that did it, but horror at
the sight of that yawning abyss which is called the human heart. I
have been confronted with the same sight myself once, when out of two
beautiful eyes suddenly shot strange glances as if some evil beast had
appeared behind those eyes. It scared me literally so that I had to see
if some other person were standing behind that face, which looked like
a mask.&mdash;But why do we sit here talking about such things? Is it the
heat, or the storm, or what?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Solitude brings heavy thoughts, and you ought to have company.
This summer in the city seems to have been rather hard on you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Only these last few weeks. The sickness and that death up
above&mdash;it was as if I had gone through it myself. The sorrows and
cares of the confectioner have also become my own, so that I keep
worrying about his finances, about his wife's eye trouble, about his
future&mdash;and of late I have been dreaming every night about my little
Anne-Charlotte. I see her surrounded by dangers&mdash;unknown, undiscovered,
nameless. And before I fall asleep my hearing grows so unbelievably
acute that I can hear her little steps&mdash;and once I heard her voice&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. But where is she then?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Don't ask me!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. And if you were to meet her on the street?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. I imagine that I should lose my reason or fall in a faint.
Once, you know, I stayed abroad very long, during the very time when
our youngest sister was growing up. When I returned, after several
years, I was met at the steam-boat landing by a young girl who put
her arms around my neck. I was horrified at those eyes that searched
mine, but with unfamiliar glances&mdash;glances that expressed absolute
terror at not being recognised. "It is I," she repeated again and again
before at last I was able to recognise my own sister. And that's how I
imagine it would be for me to meet my daughter again. Five years are
enough to render you unrecognisable at that age. Think of it: not to
know your own child! That child, who is the same as before, and yet a
stranger! I couldn't survive such a thing. No, then I prefer to keep
the little girl of four years whom you see over there on the altar of
my home. I want no other one. [<i>Pause</i>] That must be Louise putting
things to rights in the linen closet. It has such a clean smell, and it
reminds me&mdash;oh, the housewife at her linen closet; the good fairy that
preserves and renews; the housewife with her iron, who smooths out all
that has been ruffled up and who takes out all wrinkles&mdash;the wrinkles,
yes&mdash;[<i>Pause</i>] Now&mdash;I'll&mdash;go in there to write a letter. If you'll
stay, I'll be out again soon.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>He goes out to the left</i>.</p>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">CONSUL</span> <i>coughs</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. [<i>Appears in the door to the hallway</i>] Are you&mdash;[<i>The clock
strikes</i>] Oh, mercy! That sound&mdash;which has remained in my ears for ten
years! That clock which never kept time and yet measured the long hours
and days and nights of five years. [<i>She looks around</i>] My piano&mdash;my
palms&mdash;the dinner-table&mdash;he has kept it in honour, shining as a
shield! My buffet&mdash;with the "Knight in Armour" and "Eve"&mdash;Eve with her
basketful of apples&mdash;In the right-hand upper drawer, way back, there
was a thermometer lying&mdash;[<i>Pause</i>] I wonder if it is still there? [<i>She
goes to the buffet and pulls out the right-hand drawer</i>] Yes, there it
is!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. What does that mean?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. Oh, in the end it became a symbol&mdash;of instability. When we went
to housekeeping the thermometer was not put in its place at once&mdash;of
course, it ought to be outside the window. I promised to put it up&mdash;and
forgot it. He promised, and forgot. Then we nagged each other about
it, and at last, to get away from it, I hid it in this drawer. I came
to hate it, and so did he. Do you know what was back of all that?
Neither one of us believed that our relationship would last, because we
unmasked at once and gave free vent to our antipathies. To begin with,
we lived on tiptoe, so to speak&mdash;always ready to fly off at a moment's
notice. That was what the thermometer stood for&mdash;and here it is still
lying! Always on the move, always changeable, like the weather. [<i>She
puts away the thermometer and goes over to the chess-board</i>] My chess
pieces! Which he bought to kill the time that hung heavy on our hands
while we were waiting for the little one to come. With whom does he
play now?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. With me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. Where is he?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. He is in his room writing a letter.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. Where?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. [<i>Pointing toward the left</i>] There.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. [<i>Shocked</i>] And here he has been going for five years?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Ten years&mdash;five of them alone!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. Of course, he loves solitude.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. But I think he has had enough of it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. Will he turn me out?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Find out for yourself! You take no risk, as he is always polite.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. I didn't make that centrepiece&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. That is to say, you risk his asking you for the child.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. But it was he who should help me find it again&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Where do you think Fischer has gone, and what can be the
purpose of his flight?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. To get away from the unpleasant neighbourhood, first of all;
then to make me run after him. And he wanted the girl as a hostage, of
course.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. As to the ballet&mdash;that's something the father <i>must not</i> know,
for he hates music-halls.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. [<i>Sitting down in front of the chess-board and beginning,
absent-mindedly, to arrange the pieces</i>] Music-halls&mdash;oh, I have been
there myself.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. You?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. I have accompanied on the piano.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Poor Gerda!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. Why? I love that kind of life. And when I was a prisoner here,
it wasn't the keeper, but the prison itself, that made me fret.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. But now you have had enough?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. Now I am in love with peace and solitude&mdash;and with my child
above all.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Hush, he's coming!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. [<i>Rises as if to run away, but sinks down on the chair again</i>]
Oh!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Now I leave you. Don't think of what you are to say. It will
come of itself, like the "next move" in a game of chess.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. I fear his first glance most of all, for it will tell me whether
I have changed for better or for worse&mdash;whether I have grown old and
ugly.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. [<i>Going out to the right</i>] If he finds you looking older, then
he will dare to approach you. If he finds you as young as ever, he will
have no hope, for he is more diffident than you think.&mdash;Now!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. My eyes? Oh, I am getting a little near-sighted. But I feel
like the confectioner's old wife: there is nothing to look at. Wish I
were deaf, too! Deaf and blind! The neighbours above make such a lot of
noise at night&mdash;it's a gambling club&mdash;There now! Somebody got on the
wire to listen. [<i>He rings again</i>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span> <i>appears in the door to the hallway without being seen
by the</i> <span class="small-c">MASTER</span>; <span class="small-c">GERDA</span> <i>stares at her with mingled admiration
and hatred</i>; <span class="small-c">LOUISE</span> <i>withdraws toward the right</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. [<i>At the telephone</i>] Is that you? The cheek of it&mdash;to
break off our talk in order to listen!&mdash;To-morrow, then, at
six-fifteen.&mdash;Thank you, and the same to you!&mdash;Yes, I will,
indeed!&mdash;Good night, mother! [<i>He rings off</i>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span> <i>has disappeared</i>. <span class="small-c">GERDA</span> <i>is standing in the middle of
the floor</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. [<i>Turns around and catches sight of</i> <span class="small-c">GERDA</span>, <i>whom he gradually
recognises; then he puts his hand to his heart</i>] O Lord, was that you?
Wasn't Louise here a moment ago?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span> <i>remains silent</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. [<i>Feebly</i>] How&mdash;how did you get here?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. I hope you pardon&mdash;I just got to the city&mdash;I was passing by and
felt a longing to have a look at my old home&mdash;the windows were open&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Pause</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Do you find things as they used to be?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. Exactly, and yet different&mdash;there is a difference</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. [<i>Feeling unhappy</i>] Are you satisfied&mdash;with your life?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. Yes. I have what I was looking for.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. And the child?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. Oh, she's growing, and thriving, and lacks nothing.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Then I won't ask anything more. [<i>Pause</i>] Did you want
anything&mdash;of me&mdash;can I be of any service?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. It's very kind of you, but&mdash;I need nothing at all now when I
have seen that you lack nothing either. [<i>Pause]</i> Do you wish to see
Anne-Charlotte?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. I don't think so, now when I have heard that she is doing well.
It's so hard to begin over again. It's like having to repeat a lesson
at school&mdash;which you know already, although the teacher doesn't think
so&mdash;I have got so far away from all that&mdash;I live in a wholly different
region&mdash;and I cannot connect with the past. It goes against me to be
impolite, but I am not asking you to be seated&mdash;you are another man's
wife&mdash;and you are not the same person as the one from whom I parted.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. Am I then so&mdash;altered?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Quite strange to me! Your voice, glance, manner&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. Have I grown old?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. That I cannot tell!&mdash;They say that not a single atom in a
person's body remains wholly the same after three years&mdash;and in five
years everything is renewed. And for that reason you, who stand over
there, are not the same person as the sufferer who once sat here&mdash;you
seem such a complete stranger to me that I can only address you in the
most formal way. And I suppose it would be just the same in the case of
my daughter, too.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. Don't speak like that. I would much rather have you angry.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Why should I be angry?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. Because of all the evil I have done you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Have you? That's more than I know.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. Didn't you read the papers in the suit?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. No-o! I left that to my lawyer. [<i>He sits down</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. And the decision of the court?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. No, why should I? As I don't mean to marry again, I have no use
for that kind of documents.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Pause</i>. <span class="small-c">GERDA</span> <i>seats herself</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. What did those papers say? That I was too old?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA'S</span> <i>silence indicates assent</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Well, that was nothing but the truth, so that need not trouble
you. In my answer I said the very same thing and asked the Court to set
you free again.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. You said, that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. I said, not that I <i>was</i>, but that I was about to <i>become</i> too
old <i>for you</i>!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. [<i>Offended</i>] For me?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Yes.&mdash;I couldn't say that I was too old when we married, for
then the arrival of the child would have been unpleasantly explained,
and it was <i>our</i> child, was it not?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. You know that, of course! But&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Do you think I should be ashamed of my age?&mdash;Of course, if
I took to dancing and playing cards at night, then I might soon land
in an invalid's chair, or on the operating-table, and that would be a
shame.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. You don't look it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Did you expect the divorce to kill me?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The silence of</i> <span class="small-c">GERDA</span> <i>is ambiguous</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. There are those who assert that you <i>have</i> killed me. Do you
think I look like a dead man?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span> <i>appears embarrassed</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Some of your friends are said to have caricatured me in the
papers, but I have never seen anything of it, and those papers went
into the dump five years ago. So there is no need for your conscience
to be troubled on my behalf.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. Why did you marry me?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Don't you know why a man marries? And you know, too, that I
didn't have to go begging for love. And you ought to remember how
we laughed together at all the wiseacres who felt compelled to warn
you.&mdash;But why you led me on is something I have never been able to
explain&mdash;When you didn't look at me after the marriage ceremony, but
acted as if you had been attending somebody else's wedding, then I
thought you had made a bet that you could kill me. As the head of the
department, I was, of course, hated by all my subordinates, but they
became your friends at once. No sooner did I make an enemy than he
became <i>your</i> friend. Which caused me to remark that, while it was
right for you not to hate your enemies, it was also right that you
shouldn't <i>love</i> mine!&mdash;However, seeing where you stood, I began to
prepare for a retreat at once, but before leaving I wanted a living
proof that you had not been telling the truth, and so I stayed until
the little one arrived.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. To think that you could be so disingenuous!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. I learned to keep silent, but I never lied!&mdash;By degrees you
turned all my friends into detectives, and you lured my own brother
into betraying me. But worst of all was that your thoughtless chatter
threw suspicions on the legitimacy of the child.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. All that I took back!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. The word that's on the wing cannot be pulled back again. And
worse still: those false rumours reached the child, and now she thinks
her mother a&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. For Heaven's sake!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Well, that's the truth of it. You raised a tall tower on a
foundation of lies, and now the tower of lies is tumbling down on your
head.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. It isn't true!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Yes, it is! I met Anne-Charlotte a few minutes ago&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. You have met&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. We met on the stairs, and she said I was her uncle. Do you
know what an uncle is? That's an elderly friend of the house and the
mother. And I know that at school I am also passing as her uncle.&mdash;But
all that is dreadful for the child!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. You have met&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Yes. But why should I tell anybody about it? Haven't I a right
to keep silent? And, besides, that meeting was so shocking to me that I
wiped it out of my memory as if it had never existed.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. What can I do to rehabilitate you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. You? What could you do? That's something I can only do myself.
[<i>For a long time they gaze intently at each other</i>] And for that
matter, I have already got my rehabilitation. [<i>Pause</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. Can't I make good in some way? Can't I ask you to forgive, to
forget&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. To restore, to repair&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Do you mean to resume, to start over again, to reinstate a
master above me? No, thanks! I don't want you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. And this I had to hear!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Well, how does it taste? [<i>Pause</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. That's a pretty centrepiece.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Yes, it's pretty.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. Where did you get it? [<i>Pause</i>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span> <i>appears in the door to the pantry with a bill in her
hand</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. [<i>Turning toward her</i>] Is it a bill?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span> <i>rises and begins to pull on her gloves with such violence that
buttons are scattered right and left</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. [<i>Taking out the money</i>] Eighteen-seventy-two. That's just
right.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. I should like to see you a moment, sir.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. [<i>Rises and goes to the door, where</i> <span class="small-c">LOUISE</span> <i>whispers something
into his ear</i>] Oh, mercy&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span> <i>goes out</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. I am sorry for you, Gerda!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. What do you mean? That I am jealous of your servant-girl?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. No, I didn't mean that.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. Yes, you meant that you were too old for me, but not for her.
I catch the insulting point&mdash;She's pretty&mdash;I don't deny it&mdash;for a
servant-girl&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. I am sorry for you, Gerda!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. Why do you say that?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Because you are to be pitied. Jealous of my servant&mdash;that ought
to be rehabilitation enough.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. Jealous, I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Why do you fly in a rage at my nice, gentle kinswoman?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. "A little more than kin."</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. No, my dear, I have long ago resigned myself&mdash;and I am
satisfied with my solitude&mdash;[<i>The telephone rings, and he goes to
answer it</i>] Mr. Fischer? No, that isn't here.&mdash;Oh, yes, that's me.&mdash;Has
he skipped?&mdash;With whom, do you say?&mdash;with Starck's daughter! Oh, good
Lord! How old is she?&mdash;Eighteen! A mere child! [<i>Rings off</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. I knew he had run away.&mdash;But with a woman!&mdash;Now you're pleased.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. No, I am not pleased. Although there is a sort of solace to my
mind in finding justice exists in this world. Life is very quick in its
movements, and now you find yourself where I was.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. Her eighteen years against my twenty-nine&mdash;I am old&mdash;too old for
him!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Everything is relative, even age.&mdash;But now let us get at
something else. Where is your child?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. My child? I had forgotten it! My child! My God! Help me! He
has taken the child with him. He loves Anne-Charlotte as his own
daughter&mdash;Come with me to the police&mdash;come!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. I? Now you ask too much.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. Help me!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. [<i>Goes to the door at the right</i>] Come, Carl Frederick&mdash;get a
cab&mdash;take Gerda down to the police station&mdash;won't you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. [<i>Enters</i>] Of course I will! We are human, are we not?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Quick! But say nothing to Starck. Matters may be straightened
out yet&mdash;Poor fellow&mdash;and I am sorry for Gerda, too!&mdash;Hurry up now!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">GERDA</span>. [<i>Looking out through the window</i>] It's beginning to rain&mdash;lend
me an umbrella. Eighteen years&mdash;only eighteen&mdash;quick, now!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>She goes out with the</i> <span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. [<i>Alone</i>] The peace of old age!&mdash;And my child in the hands of
an adventurer!&mdash;Louise!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span> <i>enters</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. He has gone out on some business. Is it still raining?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. No, it has stopped now.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Then I'll go out and cool off a little. [<i>Pause</i>] You are a
nice girl, and sensible&mdash;did you know the confectioner's daughter?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. Very slightly.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Is she pretty?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. Ye-es.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Have you known the people above us?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. I have never seen them.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. That's an evasion.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. I have learned to keep silent in this house.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. I am forced to admit that pretended deafness can be carried to
the point where it becomes dangerous.&mdash;Well, get the tea ready while I
go outside and cool off a little. And, one thing, please&mdash;you see what
is happening, of course&mdash;but don't ask me any questions.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. I? No, sir, I am not at all curious.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. [<i>Seated on the green bench</i>] That was a nice little shower we
had.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. Quite a blessing! Now the raspberries will be coming in
again&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Then I'll ask you to put aside a few jars for us. We have grown
tired of making the jam ourselves. It only gets spoiled.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. Yes, I know. Jars of jam are like mischievous children: you
have to watch them all the time. There are people who put in salicylic
acid, but those are newfangled tricks in which I take no stock.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Salicylic acid&mdash;yes, they say it's antiseptic&mdash;and perhaps it's
a good thing.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. Yes, but you can taste it&mdash;and it's a trick.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Tell me, Mr. Starck, have you got a telephone?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. No, I have no telephone.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Oh!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. Why do you ask?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Oh, I happened to think&mdash;a telephone is handy at times&mdash;for
orders&mdash;and important communications&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. That may be. But sometimes it is just as well to
escape&mdash;communications.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Quite right! Quite right!&mdash;Yes, my heart always beats a little
faster when I hear it ring&mdash;one never knows what one is going to
hear&mdash;and I want peace&mdash;peace, above all else.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. So do I.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. [<i>Looking at his watch</i>] The lamplighter ought to be here soon.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. He must have forgotten us, for I see that the lamps are already
lit further down the avenue.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Then he'll be here soon. It will be a lot of fun to see our
lamp lighted again.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The telephone in the dining-room rings</i>. <span class="small-c">LOUISE</span> <i>comes in to
answer the call. The</i> <span class="small-c">MASTER</span> <i>rises and puts one hand up to his

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. [<i>Anxiously</i>] What news?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. No change.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Was that my brother?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. No, it was the lady.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. What did she want?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. To speak to you, sir.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. I don't want to!&mdash;Have I to console my executioner? I used to
do it, but now I am tired of it.&mdash;Look up there! They have forgotten
to turn out the light&mdash;and light makes empty rooms more dreadful than
darkness&mdash;the ghosts become visible. [<i>In a lowered voice</i>] And how
about Starck's Agnes? Do you think he knows anything?</p>


<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. It's hard to tell, for he never speaks about his sorrows&mdash;nor
does anybody else in the Silent House!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Do you think he should be told?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. For Heaven's sake, no!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. But I fear it isn't the first time she gave him trouble.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. He never speaks of her.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. It's horrible! I wonder if we'll get to the end of it soon?
[<i>The telephone rings again</i>] Now it's ringing again. Don't answer. I
don't want to hear anything.&mdash;My child&mdash;in such company! An adventurer
and a strumpet!&mdash;It's beyond limit!&mdash;Poor Gerda!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. It's better to have certainty. I'll go in&mdash;You must do
something!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. I cannot move&mdash;I can receive blows, but to strike back&mdash;no!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. But if you don't repel a danger, it will press closer; and if
you don't resist, you'll be destroyed.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. But if you refuse to be drawn in, you become unassailable.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. Unassailable?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Things straighten out much better if you don't mess them up
still further by interference. How can you want me to direct matters
where so many passions are at play? Do you think I can suppress
anybody's emotions, or give them a new turn?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. But how about the child?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. I have surrendered my rights&mdash;and besides&mdash;frankly speaking&mdash;I
don't care for them&mdash;not at all now, when <i>she</i> has been here and
spoiled the images harboured in my memory. She has wiped out all the
beauty that I had cherished, and now there is nothing left.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. But that's to be set free!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Look, how empty the place seems in there&mdash;as if everybody had
moved out; and up there&mdash;as if there had been a fire.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. Who is coming there?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">AGNES</span> <i>enters, excited and frightened, but trying hard

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span> [<i>To the</i> <span class="small-c">MASTER</span>] There is Agnes? What can this mean?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Agnes? Then things are getting straightened out.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. [<i>With perfect calm</i>] Good evening, girl! Where have you been?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AGNES</span>. I have been for a walk.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AGNES</span>. Is that so? Well, here I am.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. Please go down and help her start a fire under the little oven.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AGNES</span>. Is she angry with me, then?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. You know that she cannot be angry with you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AGNES</span>. Oh, yes, but she doesn't say anything.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. Well, girl, isn't it better to escape being scolded?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">AGNES</span> <i>disappears into the gateway</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>] Does he know, or doesn't he?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. Let's hope that he will remain in ignorance.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. But what can have happened? A breach? [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">STARCK</span>] Say, Mr.
Starck&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. What is it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. I thought&mdash;Did you notice if anybody left the house a while ago?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">STARCK</span>. I saw the iceman, and also a mail-carrier, I think.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Oh! [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>] Perhaps it was a mistake&mdash;that we didn't hear
right&mdash;I can't explain it&mdash;Or maybe he is not telling the truth? What
did she say when she telephoned?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. That she wanted to speak to you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. How did it sound? Was she excited?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. I think it's rather shameless of her to appeal to me in a
matter like this.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. But the child!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Just think, I met my daughter on the stairway, and when I asked
her if she recognised me she called me uncle and told me that her
father was up-stairs. Of course, he is her stepfather, and has all the
rights&mdash;They have just spent their time exterminating me, blackguarding
me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. A cab is stopping at the corner.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Starck <i>withdraws into the gateway</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. I only hope they don't come back to burden me again! Just
think: to have to hear my child singing the praise of her father&mdash;the
other one! And then to begin the old story all over again: "Why did you
marry me?"&mdash;"Oh, you know; but what made you want me?"&mdash;"You know very
well!"&mdash;And so on, until the end of the world.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. It was the consul that came.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. How does he look?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. He is taking his time.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Practising what he is to say, I suppose. Does he look satisfied?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. Thoughtful, rather&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Hm!&mdash;That's the way it always was. Whenever he saw that woman
he became disloyal to me. She had the power of charming everybody but
me. To me she seemed coarse, vulgar, ugly, stupid; to all the rest she
seemed refined, pleasant, handsome, intelligent. All the hatred aroused
by my independence centred in her under the form of a boundless
sympathy for whoever wronged me in any way. Through her they strove to
control and influence me, to wound me, and, at last, to kill me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. Now, I'll go in and watch the telephone&mdash;I suppose this storm
will pass like all others.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Men cannot bear independence. They want you to obey them. Every
one of my subordinates in the department, down to the very messengers,
wanted me to obey him. And when I wouldn't they called me a despot. The
servants in our house wanted me to obey them and eat food that had been
warmed up. When I wouldn't, they set my wife against me. And finally
my wife wanted me to obey the child, but then I left, and then all of
them combined against the tyrant&mdash;which was I!&mdash;Get in there quick now,
Louise, so we can set off our mines out here.</p>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">CONSUL</span> <i>enters from the left</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Results&mdash;not details&mdash;please!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Let's sit down. I am a little tired.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. I think it has rained on the bench.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. It can't be too wet for me if you have been sitting on it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. As you like!&mdash;Where is my child?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Can I begin at the beginning?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Begin!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span> [<i>Speaking slowly</i>] I got to the depot with Gerda&mdash;and at the
ticket-office I discovered him and Agnes&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. So Agnes was with him?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. And so was the child!&mdash;Gerda stayed outside, and I went up to
them. At that moment <i>he</i> was handing Agnes the tickets, but when she
discovered that they were for third class she threw them in his face
and walked out to the cab-stand.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Ugh!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. As soon as I had established a connection with the man, Gerda
hurried up and got hold of the child, disappearing with it in the
crowd&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. What did the man have to say?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Oh, you know&mdash;when you come to hear the other side&mdash;and so on.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. I want to hear it. Of course, he isn't as bad as we thought&mdash;he
has his good sides&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Exactly!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. I thought so! But you don't want me to sit here listening to
eulogies of my enemy?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Oh, not eulogies, but ameliorating circumstances&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Did you ever want to listen to me when I tried to explain the
true state of affairs to you? Yes, you did listen&mdash;but your reply was
a disapproving silence, as if I had been lying to you. You have always
sided with what was wrong, and you have believed nothing but lies, and
the reason was&mdash;that you were in love with Gerda! But there was also
another reason&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Brother, don't say anything more! You see nothing but your own
side of things.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. How can you expect me to view my conditions from the standpoint
of my enemy? I cannot take sides against myself, can I?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. I am not your enemy.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Yes, when you make friends with one who has wronged me!&mdash;Where
is my child?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. What was the outcome at the depot?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. He took a south-bound train alone.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. And the others?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Disappeared.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Then I may have them after me again. [<i>Pause]</i> Did you see if
they went with him?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. He went alone.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Well, then we are done with that one, at least. Number
two&mdash;there remain now&mdash;the mother and the child.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Why is the light burning up there in their rooms?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Because they forgot to turn it out.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. I'll go up&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. No, don't go!&mdash;I only hope that they don't come back here!&mdash;To
repeat, always repeat, begin the same lesson all over again!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. But it has begun to straighten out.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Yet the worst remains&mdash;Do you think they will come back?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. Not she&mdash;not since she had to make you amends in the presence
of Louise.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. I had forgotten that! She really did me the honour of becoming
jealous! I do think there is justice in this world!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. And then she learned that Agnes was younger than herself.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Poor Gerda! But in a case like this you mustn't tell people
that justice exists&mdash;an avenging justice&mdash;for it is sheer falsehood
that they love justice! And you must deal gently with their filth. And
Nemesis&mdash;exists only for the other person.&mdash;There it's ringing again?
That telephone makes a noise like a rattlesnake!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. [<i>Going up to the window</i>] Speak out!</p>

with her little girl.</p>

home! Now it's straightened out!&mdash;Oh!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LOUISE</span>. And she asked us to turn out the light up-stairs.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER</span>. Do that at once, Louise, and pull down the shades so we don't
have to look at it any longer.</p>

moonlight.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSUL</span>. That was a blessed rain!</p>

<h4>FIRST SCENE</h4>


<blockquote>

<p><i>The left half of the background is occupied by the empty shell
of a gutted one-story brick house. In places the paper remains
on the walls, and a couple of brick stoves are still standing</i>.</p>

<p><i>Beyond the walls can be seen an orchard in bloom.</i></p>

<p><i>At the right is the front of a small inn, the sign of which
is a wreath hanging from a pole. Tables and benches are placed
outside.</i></p>

<p><i>At the left, in the foreground, there is a pile of furniture
and household utensils that have been saved from the fire</i>.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SJÃ–BLOM</span>, <i>the painter, is painting the window-frames of the
inn. He listens closely to everything that is said</i>.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>, <i>the mason, is digging in the ruins</i>.</p>

<p><i>The</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DETECTIVE</span> <i>enters</i>.</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />
<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DETECTIVE</span>. Is the fire entirely out?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. There isn't any smoke, at least.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DETECTIVE</span>. Then I want to ask a few more questions. [<i>Pause</i>] You were
born in this quarter, were you not?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. Oh, yes. It's seventy-five years now I've lived on this
street. I wasn't born when they built this house here, but my father
helped to put in the brick.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DETECTIVE</span>. Then you know everybody around here?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. We all know each other. There is something particular about
this street here. Those that get in here once, never get away from it.
That is, they move away, but they always come back again sooner or
later, until at last they are carried out to the cemetery, which is
way out there at the end of the street.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DETECTIVE</span>. You have got a special name for this quarter, haven't you?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. We call it the Bog. And all of us hate each other, and
suspect each other, and blackguard each other, and torment each other
[<i>Pause</i>.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DETECTIVE</span>. The fire started at half past ten in the evening, I
hear&mdash;was the front door locked at that time?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. Well, that's more than I know, for I live in the house next
to this.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DETECTIVE</span>. Where did the fire start?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. Up in the attic, where the student was living.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DETECTIVE</span>. Was he at home?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. No, he was at the theatre.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DETECTIVE</span>. Had he gone away and left the lamp burning, then?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. Well, that's more than I know. [<i>Pause</i>.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DETECTIVE</span>. Is the student any relation to the owner of the house?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. No, I don't think so.&mdash;Say, you haven't got anything to do
with the police, have you?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DETECTIVE</span>. How did it happen that the inn didn't catch fire?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. They slung a tarpaulin over it and turned on the hose.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DETECTIVE</span>. Queer that the apple-trees were not destroyed by the heat.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. They had just budded, and it had been raining during the day,
but the heat made the buds go into bloom in the middle of the night&mdash;a
little too early, I guess, for there is frost coming, and then the
gardener will catch it.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DETECTIVE</span>. What kind of fellow is the gardener?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. His name is Gustafson&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DETECTIVE</span>. Yes, but what sort of a man is he?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. See here: I am seventy-five&mdash;and for that reason I don't know
anything bad about Gustafson; and if I knew I wouldn't be telling it!
[<i>Pause</i>.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DETECTIVE</span>. And the owner of the house is named WalstrÃ¶m, a dyer, about
sixty years old, married&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. Why don't you go on yourself? You can't pump me any longer.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DETECTIVE</span>. Is it thought that the fire was started on purpose?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. That's what people think of all fires.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DETECTIVE</span>. And whom do they suspect?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. The insurance company always suspects anybody who has an
interest in the fire&mdash;and for that reason I have never had anything
insured.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DETECTIVE</span>. Did you find anything while you were digging?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. Mostly one finds all the door-keys, because people haven't
got time to take them along when the house is on fire&mdash;except now and
then, of course, when they have been taken away&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DETECTIVE</span>. There was no electric light in the house?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. Not in an old house like this, and that's a good thing, for
then they can't put the blame on crossed wires.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DETECTIVE</span>. Put the blame?&mdash;A good thing?&mdash;Listen&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. Oh, you're going to get me in a trap? Don't you do it, for
then I take it all back.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DETECTIVE</span>. Take back? You can't!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. Can't I?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DETECTIVE</span>. No!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. Yes! For there was no witness present.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DETECTIVE</span>. No?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. Naw!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DETECTIVE</span> <i>coughs. The</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">WITNESS</span> <i>comes in from the left</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DETECTIVE</span>. Here's <i>one</i> witness.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. You're a sly one!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DETECTIVE</span>. Oh, there are people who know how to use their brains
without being seventy-five. [<i>To the</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">WITNESS</span>] Now we'll continue with
the gardener.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>They go out to the left</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. There I put my foot in it, I guess. But that's what happens
when you get to talking.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span> <i>enters with her husband's lunch in a bundle</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. It's good you came.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. Now we'll have lunch and be good&mdash;you might well
be hungry after all this fuss&mdash;I wonder if Gustafson can pull
through&mdash;he'd just got done with his hotbeds and was about to start
digging in the open&mdash;why don't you eat?&mdash;and there's SjÃ¶blom already at
work with his putty&mdash;just think of it, that Mrs. Westerlund got off as
well as she did&mdash;morning, SjÃ¶blom, now you've got work, haven't you?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MRS. WESTERLUND</span> <i>comes in</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. Morning, morning, Mrs. Westerlund&mdash;you got out of this
fine, I must say, and then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MRS. WESTERLUND</span>. I wonder who's going to pay me for all I am losing
to-day, when there's a big funeral on at the cemetery, which always
makes it a good day for me, and just when I've had to put away all my
bottles and glassware&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. Who's that they're burying to-day? I see such a lot of
people going out that way&mdash;and then, of course, they've come to see
where the fire was, too.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MRS. WESTERLUND</span>. I don't think they're burying anybody, but I've heard
they're going to put up a monument over the bishop&mdash;worst of it is that
the stone-cutter's daughter was going to get married to the gardener's
son&mdash;him, you know, who's in a store down-town&mdash;and now the gardener
has lost all he had&mdash;isn't that his furniture standing over there?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. I guess that's some of the dyer's, too, seeing as it
came out helter-skelter in a jiffy&mdash;and where's the dyer now?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MRS. WESTERLUND</span>. He's down at the police station testifying.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. Hm-hm!&mdash;Yes, yes!&mdash;And there's my cousin now&mdash;him what
drives the hearse&mdash;he's always thirsty on his way back.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HEARSE-DRIVER</span>. [<i>Enters</i>] How do, Malvina! So you've gone and started a
little job of arson out here during the night, have you? Looks pretty,
doesn't it. Would have been better to get a new shanty instead, I guess.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MRS. WESTERLUND</span>. Oh, mercy me! But whom have you been taking out now?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HEARSE-DRIVER</span>. Can't remember what his name was&mdash;only <i>one</i> carriage
along, and no flowers on the coffin at all.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MRS. WESTERLUND</span>. Sure and it wasn't any happy funeral, then! If you
want anything to drink you'll have to go 'round to the kitchen, for
I haven't got things going on this side yet, and, for that matter,
Gustafson is coming here with a lot of wreaths&mdash;they've got something
on out at the cemetery to-day.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HEARSE-DRIVER</span>. Yes, they're going to put up a moniment to the
bishop&mdash;'cause he wrote books, I guess, and collected all kinds of
vermin&mdash;was a reg'lar vermin-hunter, they tell me.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MRS. WESTERLUND</span>. What's that?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HEARSE-DRIVER</span>. Oh, he had slabs of cork with pins on 'em, and a lot of
flies&mdash;something beyond us here&mdash;but I guess that's the proper way&mdash;can
I go out to the kitchen now?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MRS. WESTERLUND</span>. Yes, if you use the back door, I think you can get
something wet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HEARSE-DRIVER</span>. But I want to have a word with the dyer before I drive
off&mdash;I've got my horses over at the stone-cutter's, who's my second
cousin, you know. Haven't got any use for him, as you know, too, but
we're doing business together, he and I&mdash;that is, I put in a word for
him with the heirs, and so he lets me put my horses into his yard&mdash;just
let me know when the dyer shows up&mdash;luck, wasn't it, that he didn't
have his works here, too&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>He goes out, passing around the inn</i>.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MRS. WESTERLUND</span> <i>goes into the inn by the front door</i>.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>, <i>who has finished eating, begins to dig again</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. Do you find anything?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. Nails and door-hinges&mdash;all the keys are hanging in a bunch
over there by the front door.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. Did they hang there before, or did you put them there?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. No, they were hanging there when I got here.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. That's queer&mdash;for then somebody must have locked all the
doors and taken out the keys before it began burning! That's queer!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. Yes, of course, it's a little queer, for in that way it was
harder to get at the fire and save things. Yes&mdash;yes! [<i>Pause</i>.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. I worked for the dyer's father forty years ago, I did,
and I know the people, both the dyer himself and his brother what
went off to America, though they say he's back now. The father, he
was a real man, he was, but the boys were always a little so-so. Mrs.
Westerlund over here, she used to take care of Rudolph, and the two
brothers never could get along, but kept scrapping and fighting all
the time.&mdash;I've seen a thing or two, I have&mdash;yes, there's a whole lot
what has happened in that house, so I guess it was about time to get it
smoked out.&mdash;Ugh, but that was a house! One went this way and another
that, but back they had to come, and here they died and here they were
born, and here they married and were divorced.&mdash;And Arvid, the brother
what went off to America&mdash;him they thought dead for years, and at least
he didn't take what was coming to him after his father, but now they
say he's come back, though nobody has seen him&mdash;and there's such a lot
of talking&mdash;Look, there's the dyer back from the police station!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. He doesn't look happy exactly, but I suppose that's more than
can be expected&mdash;Well, who's that student that lived in the attic? How
does he hang together with the rest?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. Well, that's more than I know. He had his board there,
and read with the children.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. And also with the lady of the house?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. No-o, they played something what they called tennis,
and quarrelled the rest of the time&mdash;yes, quarrelling and backbiting,
that's what everybody is up to in this quarter.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. Well, when they broke the student's door open they found
hairpins on the floor&mdash;it had to come out, after all, even if the fire
had to sweep over it first&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. I don't think it was the dyer that came, but our
brother-in-law, Gustafson&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. He's always mad, and to-day I suppose he's worse than ever,
and so he'll have to come and dun me for what I owe him, seeing what he
has lost in the fire&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. Now you shut up!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">GUSTAFSON</span>. [<i>Enters with a basketful of funeral wreaths and other
products of his trade</i>] I wonder if I am going to sell anything to-day
so there'll be enough for food after all this rumpus?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. Didn't you carry any insurance?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">GUSTAFSON</span>. Yes, I used to have insurance on the glass panes over my
hotbeds, but this year I felt stingy, and so I put in oiled paper
instead&mdash;gosh, that I could be such a darned fool!&mdash;[<i>Scratching his
head</i>] I don't get paid for that, of course. And now I've got to cut
and paste and oil six hundred paper panes. It's as I have always said:
that I was the worst idiot among us seven children. Gee, what an ass
I was&mdash;what a booby! And then I went and got drunk yesterday. Why in
hell did I have to get drunk that day of all days&mdash;when I need all the
brains I've got to-day? It was the stone-cutter who treated, because
our children are going to get married to-night, but I should have said
no. I didn't want to, but I'm a ninny who can't say no to anybody.
And that's the way when they come and borrow money of me&mdash;I can't say
no&mdash;darned fool that I am! And then I got in the way of that policeman,
who snared me with all sorts of questions. I should have kept my mouth
shut, like the painter over there, but I can't, and so I let out this,
that, and the other thing, and he put it all down, and now I am called
as a witness!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. What was it you said?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">GUSTAFSON</span>. I said I thought&mdash;that it looked funny to me&mdash;and that
somebody must have started it.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. Oh, that's what you said!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">GUSTAFSON</span>. Yes, pitch into me&mdash;I've deserved it, goose that I am!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. And who could have started it, do you think?&mdash;Don't mind the
painter, and my old woman here never carries any tales.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">GUSTAFSON</span>. Who started it? Why, the student, of course, as it started
in his room.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. No&mdash;<i>under</i> his room!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">GUSTAFSON</span>. Under, you say? Then I <i>have</i> gone and done it!&mdash;Oh, I'll
come to a bad end, I'm sure!&mdash;<i>Under</i> his room, you say&mdash;what could
have been there&mdash;the kitchen?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. No, a closet&mdash;see, over there! It was used by the cook.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">GUSTAFSON</span>. Then it must have been her.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. Yes, but don't you say so, as you don't know.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">GUSTAFSON</span>. The stone-cutter had it in for the cook last night&mdash;I guess
he must have known a whole lot&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. You shouldn't repeat what the stone-cutter says, for one who
has served isn't to be trusted&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">GUSTAFSON</span>. Ash, that's so long ago, and the cook's a regular dragon,
for that matter&mdash;she'd always haggle over the vegetables&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. There comes the dyer from the station now&mdash;you'd better quit!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span> <i>enters, dressed in a frock coat and a high hat
with mourning on it; he carries a stick</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. It wasn't the dyer, but he looks a lot like him.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. How much is one of those wreaths?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">GARDENER</span>. Fifty cents.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Oh, that's not much.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">GARDENER</span>. No, I am such a fool that I can't charge as I should.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. [<i>Looking around</i>] Has there&mdash;been a fire&mdash;here?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">GARDENER</span>. Yes, last night.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Good God! [<i>Pause</i>] Who was the owner of the house?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">GARDENER</span>. Mr. WalstrÃ¶m.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. The dyer?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">GARDENER</span>. Yes, he used to be a dyer, all right. [<i>Pause</i>.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Where is he now?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">GARDENER</span>. He'll be here any moment.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Then I'll look around a bit&mdash;the wreath can lie here till I
come back&mdash;I meant to go out to the cemetery later.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">GARDENER</span>. On account of the bishop's monument, I suppose?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. What bishop?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">GARDENER</span>. Bishop Stecksen, don't you know&mdash;who belonged to the Academy.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Is he dead?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">GARDENER</span>. Oh, long ago!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. I see!&mdash;Well, I'll leave the wreath for a while.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>He goes out to the left, studying the ruins carefully as he
passes by</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. Perhaps he came on account of the insurance.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. Not that one! Then he would have asked in a different way.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. But he looked like the dyer just the same.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. Only he was taller.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">GUSTAFSON</span>. Now, I remember something&mdash;I should have a bridal bouquet
ready for to-night, and I should go to my son's wedding, but I have
no flowers, and my black coat has been burned. Wouldn't that make
you&mdash;Mrs. Westerlund was to furnish the myrtle for the bride's crown,
being her godmother&mdash;that's the myrtle she stole a shoot of from
the dyer's cook, who got hers from the dyer's first wife&mdash;she who
ran away&mdash;and I was to make a crown of it, and I've clean forgotten
it&mdash;well, if I ain't the worst fool that ever walked the earth! [<i>He
opens the inn door</i>] Mrs. Westerlund, can I have the myrtle now, and
I'll do the job!&mdash;I say, can I have that myrtle! Wreath, too, you
say&mdash;have you got enough for it?&mdash;No?&mdash;Well, then I'll let the whole
wedding go hang, that's all there is to it!&mdash;Let them walk up to the
minister's and have him splice them together, but it'll make the
stone-cutter mad as a hornet.&mdash;What do you think I should do?&mdash;No, I
can't&mdash;haven't slept a wink the whole night.&mdash;It's too much for a poor
human creature.&mdash;Yes, I am a ninny, I know&mdash;go for me, will you!&mdash;Oh,
there's the pot&mdash;thanks! And then I need scissors, which I haven't
got&mdash;and wire&mdash;and string&mdash;where am I to get them from?&mdash;No, of course,
nobody wants to break off his work for a thing like that.&mdash;I'm tired of
the whole mess&mdash;work fifty years, and then have it go up in smoke! I
haven't got strength to begin over again&mdash;and the way it comes all at
once, blow on blow&mdash;did you ever! I'm going to run away from it! [<i>He
goes out</i>.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH WALSTRÃ–M</span>. [<i>Enters, evidently upset, badly dressed</i>, <i>his hands
discoloured by the dyes</i>] Is it all out now, Anderson?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. Yes, now it's out.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. Has anything been discovered?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. That's a question! What's buried when it snows comes to light
when it thaws!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. What do you mean, Anderson?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. If you dig deep enough you find things.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. Have you found anything that can explain how the fire started?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. Naw, nothing of that kind.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. That means we are still under suspicion, all of us.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. Not me, I guess.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. Oh, yes, for you have been seen up in the attic at unusual
hours.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. Well, I can't always go at usual hours to look for my tools
when I've left them behind. And I did leave my hammer behind when I
fixed the stove in the student's room.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. And the stone-cutter, the gardener, Mrs. Westerlund, even the
painter over there&mdash;we are all of us under suspicion&mdash;the student, the
cook, and myself more than the rest. Lucky it was that I had paid the
insurance the day before, or I should have been stuck for good.&mdash;Think
of it: the stone-cutter suspected of arson&mdash;he who's so afraid of doing
anything wrong! He's so conscientious <i>nowadays</i> that if you ask him
what time it is he won't swear to it, as his watch <i>may</i> be wrong. Of
course, we all know he got two years, but he's reformed, and I'll swear
now he's the straightest man in the quarter.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. But the police suspect him because he went wrong once&mdash;and he
ain't got his citizenship back yet.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. Oh, there are so many ways of looking at a thing&mdash;so many
ways, I tell you.&mdash;Well, Anderson, I guess you'd better quit for the
day, seeing as you're going to the wedding to-night.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. Yes, that wedding&mdash;There was somebody looking for you a while
ago, and he said he would be back.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. Who was it?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. He didn't say.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. Police, was it?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ANDERSON</span>. Naw, I don't think so.&mdash;There he is coming now, for that
matter. [<i>He goes out, together with his wife</i>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span> <i>enters</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. [<i>Regards him with curiosity at first, then with horror; wants
to run away, but cannot move</i>] Arvid!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Rudolph!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. So it's you!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Yes. [<i>Pause</i>.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. You're not dead, then?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. In a way, yes!&mdash;I have come back from America after thirty
years&mdash;there was something that pulled at me&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I wanted to see my childhood's home once more&mdash;and I found
those ruins! [<i>Pause</i>] It burned down last night?</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. Yes, you came just in time. [<i>Pause</i>.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. [<i>Dragging his words</i>] That's the place&mdash;such a tiny place
for such a lot of destinies! There's the dining-room with the frescoed
walls: palms, and cypresses, and a temple beneath a rose-coloured
sky&mdash;that's the way I dreamt the world would look the moment I got away
from home. And the stove with its pale blossoms growing out of conches.
And the chimney cupboard with its metal doors&mdash;I remember as a child,
when we had just moved in, somebody had scratched his name on the
metal, and then grandmother told us it was the name of a man who had
killed himself in that very room. I quickly forgot all about it, but
when I later married a niece of the same man, it seemed to me as if my
destiny had been foretold on that plate of metal.&mdash;You don't believe in
that kind of thing, do you?&mdash;However, you know how my marriage ended!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. Yes, I've heard&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. And there's the nursery&mdash;yes!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. Don't let us start digging in the ruins!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Why not? After the fire is out you can read things in the
ashes. We used to do it as children, in the stove&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. Come and sit down at the table here!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. What place is that? Oh, the tavern&mdash;"The Last Nail"&mdash;where
the hearse-drivers used to stop, and where, once upon a time, condemned
culprits were given a final glass before they were taken to the
gallows&mdash;Who is keeping it?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. Mrs. Westerlund, who used to be my nurse.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Mrs. Westerlund&mdash;I remember her. It is as if the bench sank
from under me, and I was sent tumbling through the past, sixty whole
years, down into my childhood. I breathe the nursery air and feel it
pressing on my chest. You older ones weighed me down, and you made
so much noise that I was always kept in a state of fright. My fears
made me hide in the garden&mdash;then I was dragged forward and given a
spanking&mdash;always spankings&mdash;but I never knew why, and I don't know it
yet. And yet she was my mother&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. Please!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Yes, you were the favourite, and as such you always had her
support&mdash;Then we got a stepmother. Her father was an undertaker's
assistant, and for years we had been seeing him drive by with funerals.
At last he came to know us so well by sight that he used to nod and
grin at us, as if he meant to say: "Oh, I'll come for you sooner or
later!" And then he came right into our house one day, and had to be
called grandfather&mdash;when our father took his daughter for his second
wife.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. There was nothing strange in that.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. No, but somehow, as our own destinies, and those of other
people, were being woven into one web&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. Oh, that's what happens everywhere&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Exactly! It's the same everywhere. In your youth you see
the web set up. Parents, relatives, comrades, acquaintances, servants
form the warp. Later on in life the weft becomes visible. And then
the shuttle of fate runs back and forth with the thread&mdash;sometimes
it breaks, but is tied up again, and it goes on as before. The reed
clicks, the thread is packed together into curlicues, and one day the
web lies ready. In old age, when the eye has learned how to see, you
discover that those curlicues form a pattern, a monogram, an ornament,
a hieroglyph, which only then can be interpreted: that's life! The
world-weaver has woven it! [<i>Pause; he rises</i>] Over there, in that
scrap-heap, I notice the family album. [<i>He walks a few steps to the
right and picks up a photograph album</i>] That's the book of our family
fate. Grandfather and grandmother, father and mother, brothers and
sisters, relatives, acquaintances&mdash;or so-called "friends"&mdash;schoolmates,
servants, godparents. And, strange to say, wherever I have gone, in
America or Australia, to Hongkong or the Congo, everywhere I found
at least one countryman, and as we began to dig it always came out
that this man knew my family, or at least some godfather or maid
servant&mdash;that, in a word, we had some common acquaintances. I even
found a relative in the island of Formosa&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. What has put those ideas into your head?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. The fact that life, however it shaped itself&mdash;I have been
rich and poor, exalted and humbled; I have suffered a shipwreck and
passed through an earthquake&mdash;but, however life shaped itself, I always
became aware of connections and repetitions. I saw in one situation the
result of another, earlier one. On meeting <i>this</i> person I was reminded
of <i>that</i> one whom I had met in the past. There have been incidents in
my life that have come back time and again, so that I have been forced
to say to myself: this I have been through before. And I have met with
occurrences that seemed to me absolutely inevitable, or predestined.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. What have you done during all these years?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Everything! I have beheld life from every quarter, from every
standpoint, from above and from below, and always it has seemed to me
like a scene staged for my particular benefit. And in that way I have
at last become reconciled to a part of the past, and I have come to
excuse not only my own but also other people's so-called "faults." You
and I, for instance, have had a few bones to pick with each other&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span> <i>recoils with a darkening face</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Don't get scared now&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. I never get scared!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. You are just the same as ever.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. And so are you!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Am I? That's interesting!&mdash;Yes, you are still living in that
delusion about your own bravery, and I remember exactly how this false
idea became fixed in your mind. We were learning to swim, and one day
you told how you had dived into the water, and then mother said: "Yes,
Rudolph, he has courage!" That was meant for me&mdash;for me whom you had
stripped of all courage and self-assurance. But then came the day when
you had stolen some apples, and you were too cowardly to own up to it,
and so you put it on me.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. Haven't you forgotten that yet?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. I haven't forgotten, but I have forgiven.&mdash;From here, where I
am sitting, I can see that very tree, and that's what brought it into
my mind. It's over there, you see, and it bears golden pippins.&mdash;If you
look, you'll see that one of its biggest branches has been sawed off.
For it so happened that I didn't get angry with you on account of my
unjust punishment, but my anger turned against the tree. And two years
later that big branch was all dried up and had to be sawed off. It made
me think of the fig-tree that was cursed by the Saviour, but I was
not led into any presumptuous conclusions.&mdash;However, I still know all
those trees by heart, and once, when I had the yellow fever in Jamaica,
I counted them over, every one. Most of them are still there, I see.
There's the snow-apple which has red-striped fruit&mdash;a chaffinch used
to nest in it. There's the melon-apple, standing right in front of the
garret where I used to study for technological examinations; there's
the spitzenburg, and the late astrachan; and the pear-tree that used to
look like a poplar in miniature; and the one with pears that could only
be used for preserves&mdash;they never ripened, and we despised them, but
mother treasured them above all the rest; and in that tree there used
to be a wryneck that was always twisting its head around and making a
nasty cry&mdash;That was fifty years ago!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. [<i>Irately</i>] What are you driving at?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Just as touchy and ill-tempered as ever! It's
interesting.&mdash;There was no special purpose back of my chatter&mdash;my
memories insist on pushing forward&mdash;I remember that the garden was
rented to somebody else once, but we had the right to play in it.
To me it seemed as if we had been driven out of paradise&mdash;and the
tempter was standing behind every tree. In the fall, when the ground
was strewn with ripe apples, I fell under a temptation that had become
irresistible&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. You stole, too?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Of course I did, but I didn't put it off on you!&mdash;When I was
forty I leased a lemon grove in one of the Southern States, and&mdash;well,
there were thieves after the trees every night. I couldn't sleep, I
lost flesh, I got sick. And then I thought of&mdash;poor Gustafson here!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. He's still living.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Perhaps he, too, stole apples in his childhood?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. Probably.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Why are your hands so black?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. Because I handle dyed stuffs all the time.&mdash;Did you have
anything else in mind?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. What could that have been?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. That my hands were not clean.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Fudge!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. Perhaps you are thinking of your inheritance?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Just as mean as ever! Exactly as you were when eight years
old!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. And you are just as heedless, and philosophical, and silly!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. It's a curious thing&mdash;but I wonder how many times before we
have said just what we are saying now? [<i>Pause</i>] I am looking at your
album here&mdash;our sisters and brothers&mdash;five dead!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. And our schoolmates?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. Some taken and some left behind.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. I met one of them in South Carolina&mdash;Axel Ericson&mdash;do you
remember him?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. I do.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. One whole night, while we were on a train together, he kept
telling me how our highly respectable and respected family consisted of
nothing but rascals; that it had made its money by smuggling&mdash;you know,
the toll-gate was right here; and that this house had been built with
double walls for the hiding of contraband. Don't you see that the walls
are double?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. [<i>Crushed</i>] So that's the reason why we had closets everywhere?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. The father of that fellow, Ericson, had been in the
custom-house service and knew our father, and the son told me a lot
of inside stories that turned my whole world of imagined conditions
topsyturvy.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. You gave him a licking, I suppose?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Why should I lick him?&mdash;However, my hair turned grey that
night, and I had to edit my entire life over again. You know how we
used to live in an atmosphere of mutual admiration; how we regarded
our family as better than all others, and how, in particular, our
parents were looked up to with almost religious veneration. And then I
had to paint new faces on them, strip them, drag them down, eliminate
them. It was dreadful! Then the ghosts began to walk. The pieces of
those smashed figures would come together again, but not properly,
and the result would be a regular wax cabinet of monsters. All those
grey-haired gentlemen whom we called uncles, and who came to our house
to play cards and eat cold suppers, they were smugglers, and some of
them had been in the pillory&mdash;Did you know that?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. [<i>Completely overwhelmed</i>] No.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. The dye works were merely a hiding-place for smuggled yarn,
which was dyed in order to prevent identification. I can still remember
how I used to hate the smell of the dyeing vat&mdash;there was something
sickeningly sweet about it.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. Why did you have to tell me all this?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Why should I keep silent about it and let you make yourself
ridiculous by your boasting about that revered family of yours? Have
you never noticed people grinning at you?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. No-o! [<i>Pause</i>.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. I am now looking at father's bookcase in the pile over there.
It was always locked, you remember. But one day, when father was out,
I got hold of the key. The books in front I had seen through the glass
doors, of course. There were volumes of sermons, the collected works
of great poets, handbooks for gardening, compilations of the statutes
referring to customs duties and the confiscation of smuggled goods; the
constitution; a volume about foreign coins; and a technical work that
later determined my choice of a career. But back of those books there
was room for other things, and I began to explore. First of all I found
the rattan&mdash;and, do you know, I have since learned that that bitter
plant bears a fruit from which we get the red dye known as "dragon's
blood": now, isn't that queer! And beside the rattan stood a bottle
labelled "cyanide of potassium."</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. I suppose it was meant for use over at the works.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Or elsewhere, perhaps. But this is what I had in mind: there
were some bundles of pamphlets with illustrated covers that aroused my
interest. And, to put it plain, they contained the notorious memoirs
of a certain chevalier&mdash;I took them out and locked the case again. And
beneath the big oak over there I studied them. We used to call that oak
the Tree of Knowledge&mdash;and it was, all right! And in that way I left
my childhood's paradise to become initiated, all too early, into those
mysteries which&mdash;yes!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. You, too?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Yes, I, too! [<i>Pause</i>] However&mdash;let us talk of something
else, as all that is now in ashes.&mdash;Did you have any insurance?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. [<i>Angrily</i>] Didn't you ask that a while ago?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Not that I can recall. It happens so often that I confuse
what I have said with what I have intended to say, and mostly because I
think so intensely&mdash;ever since that day when I tried to hang myself in
the closet.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. What is that you are saying?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. I tried to hang myself in the closet.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. [<i>Speaking very slowly</i>] Was that what happened that Holy
Thursday Eve, when you were taken to the hospital&mdash;what the rest of us
children were never permitted to know?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. [<i>Speaking in the same manner</i>] Yes.&mdash;There you can see how
little we know about those that are nearest to us, about our own homes
and our own lives.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. But why did you do it?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. I was twelve years old, and tired of life! It was like
groping about in a great darkness&mdash;I couldn't understand what I had to
do here&mdash;and I thought the world a madhouse. I reached that conclusion
one day when our school was turned out with torches and banners to
celebrate "the destroyer of our country." For I had just read a book
which proved that our country had been brought to destruction by the
worst of all its kings&mdash;and that was the one whose memory we had to
celebrate with hymns and festivities.<a name="FNanchor_1_3" id="FNanchor_1_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_3" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Pause</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. What happened at the hospital?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. My dear fellow, I was actually put into the morgue as dead.
Whether I was or not, I don't know&mdash;but when I woke up, most of my
previous life had been forgotten, and I began a new one, but in such a
manner that the rest of you thought me peculiar.&mdash;Are you married again?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. I have wife and children&mdash;somewhere.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. When I recovered consciousness I seemed to myself another
person. I regarded life with cynical calm: it probably had to be the
way it was. And the worse it turned out the more interesting it became.
After that I looked upon myself as if I were somebody else, and I
observed and studied that other person, and his fate, thereby rendering
myself callous to my own sufferings. But while dead I had acquired new
faculties&mdash;I could see right through people, read their thoughts, hear
their intentions. In company, I beheld them stripped naked&mdash;Where did
you say the fire started?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. Why, nobody knows.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. But the newspapers said that it began in a closet right
under the student's garret&mdash;what kind of a student is he?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. [<i>Appalled</i>] Is it in the newspapers? I haven't had time to
look at them to-day. What more have they got?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. They have got everything.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. Everything?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. The double walls, the respected family of smugglers, the
pillory, the hairpins&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. What hairpins?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. I don't know, but they are there. Do you know?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. Naw!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Everything was brought to light, and you may look for a
stream of people coming here to stare at all that exposed rottenness.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. Lord have mercy! And you take pleasure at seeing your family
dragged into scandal?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. My family? I have never felt myself related to the rest of
you. I have never had any strong feeling either for my fellow men or
myself. I think it's interesting to watch them&mdash;that's all&mdash;What sort
of a person is your wife?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. Was there anything about her, too?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. About her and the student.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. Good! Then I was right. Just wait and you'll see!&mdash;There comes
the stone-cutter.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. You know him?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. And so do you. A schoolmate&mdash;Albert Ericson.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Whose father was in the customs service and whose brother I
met on the train&mdash;he who was so very well informed about our family.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. That's the infernal cuss who has blabbed to the papers, then!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ERICSON</span> <i>enters with a pick and begins to look over the ruins</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. What a ghastly figure!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. He's been in jail&mdash;two years. Do you know what he did? He made
some erasures in a contract between him and myself&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. You sent him to jail! And now he has had his revenge!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. But the queerest part of it is that nowadays he is regarded as
the most honest man in the whole district. He has become a martyr, and
almost a saint, so that nobody dares say a word against him.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. That's interesting, indeed!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DETECTIVE</span>. [<i>Entering, turns to</i> <span class="small-c">ERICSON</span>] Can you pull down that wall
over there?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ERICSON</span>. The one by the closet?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DETECTIVE</span>. That's the one.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ERICSON</span>. That's where the fire started, and I'm sure you'll find a
candle or a lamp around there&mdash;for I know the people!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DETECTIVE</span>. Go ahead then!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ERICSON</span>. The closet door was burned off, to be sure, but the ceiling
came down, and that's why we couldn't find out, but now we'll use the
beak on it! [<i>He falls to with his pick</i>] Ho-hey, ho-ho!&mdash;Ho-hey,
leggo!&mdash;Ho-hey, for that one!&mdash;Do you see anything?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DETECTIVE</span>. Not yet.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ERICSON</span>. [<i>Working away as before</i>] Now I can see something!&mdash;The lamp
has exploded, but the stand is left!&mdash;Who knows this forfeit for his
own?&mdash;Didn't I see the dyer somewhere around here?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DETECTIVE</span>. There he is sitting now. [<i>He picks the lamp from the debris
and holds it up</i>] Do you recognise your lamp, Mr. WalstrÃ¶m?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. That isn't mine&mdash;it belonged to our tutor.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DETECTIVE</span>. The student? Where is he now?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. He's down-town, but I suppose he'll soon be here, as his books
are lying over there.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DETECTIVE</span>. How did his lamp get into the cook's closet? Did he have
anything to do with her?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. Probably!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DETECTIVE</span>. The only thing needed now is that he identify the lamp as
his own, and he will be arrested. What do you think of it, Mr. WalstrÃ¶m?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. I? Well, what is there to think?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DETECTIVE</span>. What reason could he have for setting fire to another
person's house?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. I don't know. Malice, or mere mischief&mdash;you never can tell
what people may do&mdash;Or perhaps there was something he wanted to cover
up.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DETECTIVE</span>. That would have been a poor way, as old rottenness always
will out. Did he have any grudge against you?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. It's likely, for I helped him once when he was hard up, and he
has hated me ever since, of course.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DETECTIVE</span>. Of course? [<i>Pause</i>] Who is he, then?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. He was raised in an orphanage&mdash;born of unknown parents.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DETECTIVE</span>. Haven't you a grown-up daughter, Mr. WalstrÃ¶m?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. [<i>Angered</i>] Of course I have!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DETECTIVE</span>. Oh, you have! [<i>Pause; then to</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ERICSON</span>] Now you bring those
twelve men of yours and pull down the walls quick. Then we'll see what
new things come to light.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>He goes out</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ERICSON</span>. That'll be done in a jiffy. [<i>Goes out</i>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Pause</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Have you really paid up your insurance?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. Of course!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Personally?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. No, I sent it in as usual.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. You sent it&mdash;by somebody else! That's just like you!&mdash;Suppose
we take a turn through the garden and have a look at the apple-trees.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. All right, and then we'll see what happens afterward.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Now begins the most interesting part of all.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. Perhaps not quite so interesting if you find yourself mixed up
in it.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. I?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. Who can tell?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. What a web it is!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. There was a child of yours that went to the orphanage, I think?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. God bless us!&mdash;Let's go over into the garden!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. [<i>Entering</i>] There they stand, enjoying the misfortune that's
in the air and waiting for the victim to appear&mdash;he being the principal
item. That the fire was incendiary they take for granted, merely
because they want it that way.&mdash;And all these rascals are the friends

dynamite stored in the cellar, and if such were the case an explosion
might take place any moment.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. [Stoops <i>over the scrap-heap and begins to poke in the
books piled there</i>] Those are the student's books&mdash;Same kind of rot
as in my youth&mdash;Livy's Roman history, which is said to be lies, every
word&mdash;But here's a volume out of my brother's library&mdash;"Columbus, or
the Discovery of America"! My own book, which I got as a Christmas
gift in 1857. My name has been erased. This means it was stolen from
me&mdash;and I accused one of our maids, who was discharged on that account!
Fine business! Perhaps it led to her ruin&mdash;fifty years ago! Here is
the frame of one of our family portraits; my renowned grandfather,
the smuggler, who was put in the pillory&mdash;fine!&mdash;But what is this?
The foot-piece of a mahogany bed&mdash;the one in which I was born! Oh,
damn!&mdash;Next item: a leg of a dinner-table&mdash;the one that was an
heirloom. Why, it was supposed to be of ebony, and was admired on
that account! And now, after fifty years, I discover it to be made
of painted maple. Everything had its colours changed in our house to
render it unrecognisable, even the clothes of us children, so that
our bodies always were stained with various dyes. Ebony&mdash;humbug! And
here's the dining-room clock&mdash;smuggled goods, that, too&mdash;which has
measured out the time for two generations. It was wound up every
Saturday, when we had salt codfish and a posset made with beer for
dinner. Like all intelligent clocks, it used to stop when anybody
died, but when I died it went on just as before. Let me have a look at
you, old friend&mdash;I want to see your insides. [<i>As he touches the clock
it falls to pieces</i>] Can't stand being handled! Nothing could stand
being handled in our home&mdash;nothing! Vanity, vanity!&mdash;But there's the
globe that was on top of the clock, although it ought to have been at
the bottom. You tiny earth: you, the densest and the heaviest of all
the planets&mdash;that's what makes everything on you so heavy&mdash;so heavy
to breathe, so heavy to carry. The cross is your symbol, but it might
just as well have been a fool's cap or a strait-jacket&mdash;you world of
delusions and deluded!&mdash;Eternal One&mdash;perchance Thy earth has gone
astray in the limitless void? And what set it whirling so that Thy
children were made dizzy, and lost their reason, and became incapable
of seeing what really is instead of what only seems?&mdash;Amen!&mdash;And here
is the student!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>The</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STUDENT</span> <i>enters and looks around in evident search of
somebody</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. He is looking for the mistress of the house. And he tells
everything he knows&mdash;with his eyes. Happy youth!&mdash;Whom are you looking
for?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STUDENT</span>. [<i>Embarrassed</i>] I was looking&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Speak up, young man&mdash;or keep silent. I understand you just
the same.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STUDENT</span>. With whom have I the honour&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. It's no special honour, as you know, for once I ran away to
America on account of debts&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STUDENT</span>. That wasn't right.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Right or wrong, it remains a fact.&mdash;So you were looking for
Mrs. WalstrÃ¶m? Well, she isn't here, but I am sure that she will come
soon, like all the rest, for they are drawn by the fire like moths&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STUDENT</span>. By a candle!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. That's what <i>you</i> say, but I should rather have said "lamp,"
in order to choose a more significant word. However, you had better
hide your feelings, my dear fellow, if you can&mdash;I can hide mine!&mdash;We
were talking of that lamp, were we not? How about it?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STUDENT</span>. Which lamp?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Well, well! Every one of them lies and denies!&mdash;The lamp
that was placed in the cook's closet and set fire to the house?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STUDENT</span>. I know nothing about it.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Some blush when they lie and others turn pale. This one has
invented an entirely new manner.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STUDENT</span>. Are you talking to yourself, sir?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. I have that bad habit.&mdash;Are your parents still living?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STUDENT</span>. They are not.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Now you lied again, but unconsciously.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STUDENT</span>. I never tell a lie!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Not more than three in these few moments! I know your father.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STUDENT</span>. I don't believe it.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. So much the better for me!&mdash;Do you see this scarf-pin? It's
pretty, isn't it? But I never see anything of it myself&mdash;I have no
pleasure in its being there, while everybody else is enjoying it. There
is nothing selfish about that, is there? But there are moments when
I should like to see it in another man's tie so that I might have a
chance to admire it. Would you care to have it?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STUDENT</span>. I don't quite understand&mdash;Perhaps, as you said, it's better
not to wear it.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Perhaps!&mdash;Don't get impatient now. She will be here soon.&mdash;Do
you find it enviable to be young?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STUDENT</span>. I can't say that I do.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. No, youth is not its own master; it has never any money, and
has to take its food out of other hands; it is not permitted to speak
when company is present, but is treated as an idiot; and as it cannot
marry, it has to ogle other people's wives, which leads to all sorts of
dangerous consequences. Youth&mdash;humbug!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STUDENT</span>. That's right! As a child, you want to grow up&mdash;that is, reach
fifteen, be confirmed, and put on a tall hat. When you are that far,
you want to be old&mdash;that is, twenty-one. Which means that nobody wants
to be young.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. And when you grow old in earnest, then you want to be dead.
For then there isn't much left to wish for.&mdash;Do you know that you are
to be arrested?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STUDENT</span>. Am I?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. The detective said so a moment ago.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STUDENT</span>. Me?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Are you surprised at that? Don't you know that in this life
you must be prepared for anything?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STUDENT</span>. But what have I done?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. You don't have to do anything in order to be arrested. To be
suspected is enough.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STUDENT</span>. Then everybody might be arrested!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Exactly! The rope might be laid around the neck of the whole
race if justice were wanted, but it isn't. It's a disgusting race:
ugly, sweating, ill-smelling; its linen dirty, its stockings full of
holes; with chilblains and corns&mdash;ugh! No, an apple-tree in bloom is
far more beautiful. Or look at the lilies in the field&mdash;they seem
hardly to belong here&mdash;and what fragrance is theirs!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STUDENT</span>. Are you a philosopher, sir?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Yes, I am a great philosopher.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STUDENT</span>. Now you are poking fun at me!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. You say that to get away. Well, begone then! Hurry up!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STUDENT</span>. I was expecting somebody.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. So I thought. But I think it would be better to go and
meet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STUDENT</span>. She asked you to tell me?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Oh, that wasn't necessary.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STUDENT</span>. Well, if that's so&mdash;I don't want to miss&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>He goes out</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Can that be my son? Well, if it comes to the worst&mdash;I was a
child myself once, and it was neither remarkable nor pleasant&mdash;And I
am his&mdash;what of it? And for that matter&mdash;who knows?&mdash;Now I'll have a
look at Mrs. Westerlund. She used to work for my parents&mdash;was faithful
and good-tempered; and when she had been pilfering for ten years she
was raised to the rank of a "trusted" servant. [<i>He seats himself at
the table in front of the inn</i>] There are Gustafson's wreaths&mdash;just as
carelessly made as they were forty years ago. He was always careless
and stupid in all he did, and so he never succeeded with anything. But
much might be pardoned him on account of his self-knowledge. "Poor
fool that I am," he used to say, and then he would pull off his cap
and scratch his head.&mdash;Why, there's a myrtle plant! [<i>He knocks at the
pot</i>] Not watered, of course! He always forgot to water his plants, the
damned fool&mdash;and yet he expected them to grow.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SJÃ–BLOM</span>, <i>the painter, appears</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. I wonder who that painter can be. Probably he belongs also to
the Bog, and perhaps he is one of the threads in my own web.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SJÃ–BLOM</span> <i>is staring at the</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span> <i>all this time</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. [<i>Returning the stare</i>] Well, do you recognise me?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SJÃ–BLOM</span>. Are you&mdash;Mr. Arvid?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Have been and am&mdash;if perception argues being.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Pause</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SJÃ–BLOM</span>. I ought really to be mad at you.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Well, go on and be so! However, you might tell me the reason.
That has a tendency to straighten matters out.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SJÃ–BLOM</span>. Do you remember&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Unfortunately, I have an excellent memory.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SJÃ–BLOM</span>. Do you remember a boy named Robert?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Yes, a regular rascal who knew how to draw.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SJÃ–BLOM</span>. And I was to go to the Academy in order to become a real
painter, an artist. But just about that time-colour-blindness was all
the go. You were studying at the Technological Institute then, and so
you had to test my eyes before your father would consent to send me to
the art classes. For that reason you brought two skeins of yarn from
the dye works, one red and the other green, and then you asked me about
them. I answered&mdash;called the red green and the green red&mdash;and that was
the end of my career&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. But that was as it should be.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SJÃ–BLOM</span>. No&mdash;for the truth of it was, I could distinguish the
colours, but not&mdash;the <i>names</i>. And that wasn't found out until I was
thirty-seven&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. That was an unfortunate story, but I didn't know better, and
so you'll have to forgive me.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SJÃ–BLOM</span>. How can I?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Ignorance is pardonable! And now listen to me. I wanted to
enter the navy, made a trial cruise as mid-shipman, seemed to become
seasick, and was rejected! But I could stand the sea, and my sickness
came from having drunk too much. So my career was spoiled, and I had to
choose another.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SJÃ–BLOM</span>. What have I got to do with the navy? I had been dreaming of
Rome and Paris&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Oh, well, one has so many dreams in youth, and in old age
too, for that matter. Besides, what's the use of bothering about what
happened so long ago?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SJÃ–BLOM</span>. How you talk! Perhaps you can give me back my wasted life&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. No, I can't, but I am under no obligation to do so, either.
That trick with the yarn I had learned at school, and you ought to have
learned the proper names of the colours. And now you can go to&mdash;one
dauber less is a blessing to humanity!&mdash;There's Mrs. Westerlund!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SJÃ–BLOM</span>. How you <i>do</i> talk. But I guess you'll get what's coming to you!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MRS. WESTERLUND</span> <i>enters</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. How d'you do, Mrs. Westerlund? I am Mr. Arvid&mdash;don't get
scared now! I have been in America, and how are you? I am feeling fine!
There has been a fire here, and I hear your husband is dead&mdash;policeman,
I remember, and a very nice fellow. I liked him for his good humour
and friendly ways. He was a harmless jester, whose quips never hurt. I
recall once&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MRS. WESTERLUND</span>. O, merciful! Is this my own Arvid whom I used to
tend&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. No, that wasn't me, but my brother&mdash;but never mind, it's just
as well meant. I was talking of your old man who died thirty-five years
ago&mdash;a very nice man and a particular friend of mine&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MRS. WESTERLUND</span>. Yes, he died. [<i>Pause</i>] But I don't know if&mdash;perhaps
you are getting him mixed up&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. No, I don't. I remember old man Westerlund perfectly, and I
liked him very much.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MRS. WESTERLUND</span>. [<i>Reluctantly</i>] Of course it's a shame to say it, but
I don't think his temper was very good.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. What?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MRS. WESTERLUND</span>. Well&mdash;he had a way of getting around people, but
he didn't mean what he said&mdash;or if he did he meant it the other way
around&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. What is that? Didn't he mean what he was saying? Was he a
hypocrite?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MRS. WESTERLUND</span>. Well, I don't like to say it, but I believe&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Do you mean to say that he wasn't on the level?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MRS. WESTERLUND</span>. N&mdash;yes&mdash;he was&mdash;a little&mdash;well, he didn't mean exactly
what he said&mdash;And how have you been doing, Mr. Arvid?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Now a light is dawning on me!&mdash;The miserable wretch! And
here I have been praising him these thirty-five years. I have missed
him, and I felt something like sorrow at his departure&mdash;I even used
some of my tobacco allowance to buy a wreath for his coffin.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MRS. WESTERLUND</span>. What was it he did? What was it?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. The villain! [<i>Pause</i>] Well&mdash;he fooled me&mdash;it was Shrove
Tuesday, I remember. He told me that if one took away every third
egg from a hen she would lay so many more. I did it, got a licking,
and came near getting into court. But <i>I</i> never suspected him of
having told on me.&mdash;He was always hanging around our kitchen looking
for tid-bits, and so our maids could do just what they pleased about
the garbage&mdash;oh, now I see him in his proper aspect!&mdash;And here I am
now getting into a fury at one who has been thirty-five years in his
grave?&mdash;So he was a satirist, he was&mdash;and I didn't catch on&mdash;although I
understand him now.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MRS. WESTERLUND</span>. Yes, he was a little satirical all right&mdash;<i>I</i> ought
to know that!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Other things are coming back to me now&mdash;and I have been
saying nice things about that blackguard for thirty-five years! It was
at his funeral I drank my first toddy&mdash;And I remember how he used to
flatter me, and call me "professor" and "the crown prince"&mdash;ugh&mdash;And
there is the stone-cutter! You had better go inside, madam, or we'll
have a row when that fellow begins to turn in his bills. Good-bye,
madam&mdash;we'll meet again!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MRS. WESTERLUND</span>. No we won't. People ought never to meet again&mdash;it
is never as it used to be, and they only get to clawing at each
other&mdash;What business did you have to tell me all those things&mdash;seeing
everything was all right as it was [<i>She goes out</i>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ERICSON</span>, <i>the stone-cutter, comes in</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Come on!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERICSON</span>. What's that?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Come on, I said!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ERICSON</span> <i>stares at him</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Are you looking at my scarf-pin? I bought it in London.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERICSON</span>. I am no thief!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. No, but you practise the noble art of erasure. You wipe out!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERICSON</span>. That's true, but that contract was sheer robbery, and it was
strangling me.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Why did you sign it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERICSON</span>. Because I was hard up.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Yes, that <i>is</i> a motive.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERICSON</span>. But now I am having my revenge.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Yes, isn't it nice!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERICSON</span>. And now <i>they</i> will be locked up.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Did <i>we</i> ever fight each other as boys?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERICSON</span>. No, I was too young.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Have we never told lies about each other, or robbed each
other, or got in each other's way, or seduced each other's sisters?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERICSON</span>. Naw, but my father was in the customs service and yours was a
smuggler.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. There you are! That's something, at least!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERICSON</span>. And when my father failed to catch yours he was discharged.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. And you want to get even with me because your father was a
good-for-nothing?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERICSON</span>. Why did you say a while ago that there was dynamite in the
cellar?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Now, my dear sir, you are telling lies again. I said there
<i>might</i> be dynamite in the cellar, and everything is possible, of
course.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERICSON</span>. And in the meantime the student has been arrested. Do you know
him?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Very little&mdash;his mother more, for she was a maid in our
house. She was both pretty and good, and I was making up to her&mdash;until
she had a child.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERICSON</span>. And were you not its father?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. I was not. But as a denial of fatherhood is not allowed, I
suppose I must be regarded as a sort of stepfather.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERICSON</span>. Then they have lied about you.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Of course. But that's a very common thing.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERICSON</span>. And I was among those who testified against you&mdash;under oath!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. I have no doubt about it, but what does it matter? Nothing
matters at all! But now we had better quit pulling&mdash;or we'll get the
whole web unravelled.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERICSON</span>. But think of me, who have perjured myself&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Yes, it isn't pleasant, but such things will happen.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERICSON</span>. It's horrible&mdash;don't you find life horrible?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. [<i>Covering his eyes with his hand</i>] Yes, horrible beyond all
description!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERICSON</span>. I don't want to live any longer!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Must! [<i>Pause</i>] Must! [<i>Pause</i>] Tell me&mdash;the student is
arrested, you say&mdash;can he get out of it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERICSON</span>. Hardly!&mdash;And now, as we are talking nicely, I'll tell you
something: he is innocent, but he cannot clear himself. For the only
witness that can prove him innocent would, by doing so, prove him
guilty&mdash;in another way.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. She with the hairpins, isn't it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERICSON</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. The old one or the young one?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERICSON</span>. You have to figure that out yourself. But it isn't the cook.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. What a web this is!&mdash;But who put the lamp there?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERICSON</span>. His worst enemy.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. And did his worst enemy also start the fire?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERICSON</span>. That's beyond me! Only Anderson, the mason, knows that.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Who is he?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERICSON</span>. The oldest one in the place&mdash;some kind of relative of Mrs.
Westerlund&mdash;knows all the secrets of the house&mdash;but he and the dyer
have got some secrets together, so he won't tell anything.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. And the lady&mdash;my sister-in-law&mdash;who is she?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERICSON</span>. Well&mdash;she was in the house as governess when the first wife
cleared out.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. What sort of character has she got?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERICSON</span>. Hm! Character? I don't quite know what that is. Do you mean
trade? The old assessment blanks used to call for your name and
"character"&mdash;but that meant occupation instead of character.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. I mean her temper.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERICSON</span>. Well, it changes, you know. In me it depends on the person
with whom I am talking. With decent people I am decent, and with the
cruel ones I become like a beast of prey.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. But I was talking of her temper under ordinary circumstances.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERICSON</span>. Well, nothing in particular. Gets angry if you tease her, but
comes around after a while. One cannot always have the same temper, of
course.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. I mean, is she merry or melancholy?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERICSON</span>. When things go right, she is happy, and when they go wrong,
she gets sorry or angry&mdash;just like the rest of us.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Yes, but how does she behave?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERICSON</span>. Oh, what does it matter?&mdash;Of course, being an educated person,
she behaves politely, but nevertheless, you know, she can get nasty,
too, when her blood gets to boiling.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. But that doesn't make me much wiser.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERICSON</span>. [<i>Patting him on the shoulder</i>] No, sir, we never get much
wiser when it's a question of human beings.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Oh, you're a marvel!&mdash;And how do you like my brother, the
dyer? [<i>Pause</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERICSON</span>. Oh, his manners are pretty decent. And more than that I don't
know, for what he keeps hidden I can't find out, of course.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Excellent! But&mdash;his hands are always blue, and yet you know
that they are white beneath the dye.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERICSON</span>. But to make them so they should be scraped, and that's
something he won't permit.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Good!&mdash;Who are the young couple coming over there?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERICSON</span>. That's the gardener's son and my daughter, who were to have
been married to-night, but who have had to postpone it on account of
the fire&mdash;Now I shall leave, for I don't want to embarrass them. You
understand&mdash;I ain't much as a father-in-law. Good-bye! [<i>He goes out</i>.</p>

<p><i>The</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span> <i>withdraws behind the inn, but so that he

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ALFRED</span>. I had to have a look at this place&mdash;I had to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MATHILDA</span>. Why did you have to look at it?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ALFRED</span>. Because I have suffered so much in this house that more than
once I wished it on fire.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MATHILDA</span>. Yes, I know, it kept the sun out of the garden, and now
everything will grow much better&mdash;provided they don't put up a still
higher house&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ALFRED</span>. Now it's open and pleasant, with plenty of air and sunlight,
and I hear they are going to lay out a street&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MATHILDA</span>. Won't you have to move then?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ALFRED</span>. Yes, all of us will have to move, and that's what I like&mdash;I
like new things&mdash;I should like to emigrate&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MATHILDA</span>. Mercy, no! Do you know, our pigeons were nesting on the roof.
And when the fire broke out last night they kept circling around the
place at first, but when the roof fell in they plunged right into the
flames&mdash;They couldn't part from their old home!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ALFRED</span>. But we must get out of here&mdash;must! My father says that the soil
has been sucked dry.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MATHILDA</span>. I heard that the cinders left by the fire were to be spread
over the ground in order to improve the soil.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ALFRED</span>. You mean the ashes?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MATHILDA</span>. Yes; they say it's good to sow in the ashes.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ALFRED</span>. Better still on virgin soil.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MATHILDA</span>. But your father is ruined?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ALFRED</span>. Not at all. He has money in the bank. Of course he's
complaining, but so does everybody.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MATHILDA</span>. Has he&mdash;The fire hasn't ruined him?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ALFRED</span>. Not a bit! He's a shrewd old guy, although he always calls
himself a fool.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MATHILDA</span>. What am I to believe?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ALFRED</span>. He has loaned money to the mason here&mdash;and to others.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MATHILDA</span>. I am entirely at sea! Am I dreaming?&mdash;The whole morning
we have been weeping over your father's misfortune and over the
postponement of the wedding&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ALFRED</span>. Poor little thing! But the wedding is to take place to-night&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MATHILDA</span>. Is it not postponed?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ALFRED</span>. Only delayed for a couple of hours so that my father will have
time to get his new coat.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MATHILDA</span>. And we who have been weeping&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ALFRED</span>. Useless tears&mdash;such a lot of tears!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MATHILDA</span>. I am mad because they were useless&mdash;although&mdash;to think that
my father-in-law could be such a sly one!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ALFRED</span>. Yes, he is something of a joker, to put it mildly. He is always
talking about how tired he is, but that's nothing but laziness&mdash;oh,
he's lazy, I tell you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MATHILDA</span>. Don't say any more nasty things about him&mdash;but let us get
away from here. I have to dress, you know, and put up my hair.&mdash;Just
think, that my father-in-law isn't what I thought him&mdash;that he could be
fooling us like that and not telling the truth! Perhaps you are like
that, too? Oh, that I can't know what you really are!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ALFRED</span>. You'll find out afterward.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MATHILDA</span>. But then it's too late.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ALFRED</span>. It's never too late&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MATHILDA</span>. All you who lived in this house are bad&mdash;And now I am afraid
of you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ALFRED</span>. Not of me, though?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MATHILDA</span>. I don't know what to think. Why didn't you tell me before
that your father was well off?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ALFRED</span>. I wanted to try you and see if you would like me as a poor man.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MATHILDA</span>. Yes, afterward they always say that they wanted to try you.
But how can I ever believe a human being again?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ALFRED</span>. Go and get dressed now. I'll order the carriages.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MATHILDA</span>. Are we to have carriages?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ALFRED</span>. Of course&mdash;regular coaches.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MATHILDA</span>. Coaches? And to-night? What fun! Come&mdash;hurry up! We'll have
carriages!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ALFRED</span>. [<i>Gets hold of her hand and they dance out together</i>] Hey and
ho! Here we go!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. [<i>Coming forward</i>] Bravo!</p>

<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>] Are you my brother-in-law?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. I am. [<i>Pause</i>] Don't I look as I have been described&mdash;or
painted?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MRS. WALSTRÃ–M</span>. Frankly, no!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. No, that is generally the case. And I must admit that the
information I received about you a while ago does not tally with the
original.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MRS. WALSTRÃ–M</span>. Oh, people do each other so much wrong, and they paint
each other in accordance with some image within themselves.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. And they go about like theatrical managers, distributing
parts to each other. Some accept their parts; others hand them back and
prefer to improvise.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MRS. WALSTRÃ–M</span>. And what has been the part assigned to you?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. That of a seducer. Not that I have ever been one! I have
never seduced anybody, be she wife or maid, but once in my youth I was
seduced, and that's why the part was given to me. Strange to say, it
was forced on me so long that at last I accepted it. And for twenty
years I carried the bad conscience of a seducer around with me.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MRS. WALSTRÃ–M</span>. You were innocent then?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. I was.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MRS. WALSTRÃ–M</span>. How curious! And to this day my husband is still
talking of the Nemesis that has pursued you because you seduced another
man's wife.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. I fully believe it. But your husband represents a still more
interesting case. He has created a new character for himself out of
lies. Tell me: isn't he a coward in facing the struggles of life?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MRS. WALSTRÃ–M</span>. Of course he is a coward!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. And yet he boasts of his courage, which is nothing but
brutality.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MRS. WALSTRÃ–M</span>. You know him pretty well.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Yes, and no!&mdash;And you have been living in the belief that you
had married into a respected family which had never disgraced itself?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MRS. WALSTRÃ–M</span>. So I believed until this morning.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. When your faith crumbled! What a web of lies and mistakes
and misunderstandings! And that kind of thing we are supposed to take
seriously!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MRS. WALSTRÃ–M</span>. Do you?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Sometimes. Very seldom nowadays. I walk like a somnambulist
along the edge of a roof&mdash;knowing that I am asleep, and yet being
awake&mdash;and the only thing I am waiting for is to be waked up.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MRS. WALSTRÃ–M</span>. You are said to have been across to the other side?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. I have been across the river, but the only thing I can recall
is&mdash;that there everything <i>was</i> what it pretended to be. That's what
makes the difference.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MRS. WALSTRÃ–M</span>. When nothing stands the test of being touched, what are
you then to hold on to?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Don't you know?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MRS. WALSTRÃ–M</span>. Tell me! Tell me!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Sorrow brings patience; patience brings experience;
experience brings hope; and hope will not bring us to shame.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MRS. WALSTRÃ–M</span>. Hope, yes!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Yes, hope!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MRS. WALSTRÃ–M</span>. Do you ever think it pleasant to live?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Of course. But that is also a delusion. I tell you, my dear
sister-in-law, that when you happen to be born without a film over your
eyes, then you see life and your fellow creatures as they are&mdash;and
you have to be a pig to feel at home in such a mess.&mdash;But when you
have been looking long enough at blue mists, then you turn your eyes
the other way and begin to look into your own soul? There you find
something really worth looking at.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MRS. WALSTRÃ–M</span>. And what is it you see?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Your own self. But when you have looked at that you must die.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MRS. WALSTRÃ–M</span>. [<i>Covers her eyes with her hands; after a pause she
says</i>] Do you want to help me?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. If I can.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MRS. WALSTRÃ–M</span>. Try.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Wait a moment!&mdash;No, I cannot. He is innocently accused. Only
you can set him free again. But that you cannot do. It's a net that has
not been tied by men&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MRS. WALSTRÃ–M</span>. But he is not guilty.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Who is guilty? [<i>Pause</i>.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MRS. WALSTRÃ–M</span>. No one! It was an accident!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. I know it.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MRS. WALSTRÃ–M</span>. What am I to do?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Suffer. It will pass. For that, too, is vanity.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MRS. WALSTRÃ–M</span>. Suffer?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Yes, suffer! But with hope!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MRS. WALSTRÃ–M</span>. [<i>Holding out her hand to him</i>] Thank you!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. And let it be your consolation</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MRS. WALSTRÃ–M</span>. What?</p>

confidence&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. What?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. That the premium on your insurance was paid up two hours too
late.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. Then I am ruined? [<i>Pause</i>.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Are you crying?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. I am ruined!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Well, is that something that cannot be borne?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. How am I to live? What am I to do?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Work!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. I am too old&mdash;I have no friends&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Perhaps you'll get some now. A man in misfortune always seems sympathetic. I had some of
my best hours while fortune went against me.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. [<i>Wildly</i>] I am ruined!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. But in my days of success and fortune I was left alone. Envy
was more than friendship could stand.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. Then I'll sue the bookkeeper.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Don't!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. He'll have to pay&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. How little you have changed! What's the use of living, when
you learn so little from it?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. I'll sue him, the villain!&mdash;He hates me because I gave him a
cuff on the ear once.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Forgive him&mdash;as I forgave you when I didn't demand my
inheritance.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. What inheritance?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Always the same! Merciless! Cowardly! Disingenuous!&mdash;Depart
in peace, brother!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. What inheritance is that you are talking of?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Now listen, Rudolph&mdash;my brother after all: my own mother's
son! You put the stone-cutter in jail because he did some erasing&mdash;all
right! But how about your own erasures from my book, "Christopher
Columbus, or the Discovery of America"?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. [<i>Taken aback</i>] What's that? Columbus?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Yes, <i>my</i> book that became yours!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span> <i>remains silent</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Yes, and I understand now that it was you who put the
student's lamp in the closet&mdash;I understand everything. But do <i>you</i>
know that the dinner-table was not of ebony?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. It wasn't?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. It was nothing but maple.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. Maple!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. The pride and glory of the house&mdash;valued at two thousand
crowns!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. That, too? So that was also humbug!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRANGER</span>. Yes!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RUDOLPH</span>. Ugh!</p>
